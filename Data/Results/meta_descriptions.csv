We’ve rolled out a new update to our app that includes small new improvements and features that will make your life easy.



iOS

What’s new 🙌

When signing up for a business account, we'll now ask for your VAT number to speed up the process and make life easy. 🚀

As a business user, you weren’t always able to activate the Switch Service if your personal account was a guest (free) one. That’s fixed. ⚒️

Some of our business Easy Money users weren’t able to add their cards to Apple Pay. All good now!


Android

The app would sometimes crash when adding a note to a payment. That’s fixed. 📄

For new users scanning their passports to verify, the app could crash but is fixed now!

The pop up that appears when you long-press “Profile” was broken. All good now. 📲

1,Local Currencies Accounts Fees,"['Knowledge', ""What's New?""]","Hey bunqers 🌈

With bunq, you save on conversion when spending abroad by getting the real exchange rate. With your Easy Money or Easy Green account you can now receive, convert, hold and spend in foreign currencies without having to leave your bunq app with Local Currencies. 

To give you a full fledged local currency account, there will be some changes to our billing policy. 

Open a local currency account in seconds 🌍

FREE for Easy Money and Easy Green personal users
FREE for Easy Money and Easy Green business users

Convert anytime, anywhere 🚀

0.50% Network Fee on the amount you convert.
You’ll get the real market rate! On the weekends, the rates are different as the foreign currency markets close and there is more risk. This results in an additional markup of 0.15%-0.5%, depending on the currencies you wish to convert. For the best rates, choose to convert during the week.


Pay in local currency 💷

Fast Payments available for local currencies, between €0.70 - €6.00. 
SWIFT Payments: €10.00

Receive in local currency 💵

SWIFT: €10.00
For now, only GBP can be received via local payment methods: €0.70

2,Local Currencies 💸,"['Knowledge', ""What's New?""]","Hey bunqers 🌈

Receive, convert, hold and spend in your favorite currency without having to leave your bunq app. Now you can create a sub-account and enjoy handling finances in Dollars, Pounds , Swiss Franc, Poland złoty or Bulgarian lev. Convert them within the app anytime✨

Bank like a local by making payments in the local currency from your bunq account. Paying the rent in Dollars is now possible without any intermediary, so you can really feel at home. 

How to get a Local Currency account?

Go to the Home tab
Press on +Add account
Choose 💵 Local Currencies

How can I convert money?

Go to your brand new local currency account
Click ‘More’
Click Convert ✨

How can I make a payment in a Local Currency for a new recipient?

Go to your Local Currency account
Click on 🟠 Pay 
Enter the amount you want to send 
Select + New Recipient
Enter all the required info **
Select “Send Payment”
Ready 🚀

Different countries require different information regarding the recipient so please make sure to fill all boxes required.

Who can use this feature?

The feature is available for our Easy Money and Easy Green users, no additional fee when you open your Local Currency sub-account. 💸

How do I receive money in my Local Currency account?

You can find your account details in the app, like your IBAN. The Local Currency IBAN is a UK IBAN and has a BIC/SWIFT code: TCCLGB3L.

When someone sends money to your Local Currency account, this is mostly a SWIFT payment. It takes time for these payments to arrive. SWIFT payments can take up to 5 days. There are also fees involved in receiving a SWIFT payment. You can learn more about this here

For GBP accounts, you have local account details in addition to your IBAN. If someone sends Pounds using these account details, it is processed as a Fast Payment (FPS), which is way faster and cheaper than a SWIFT payment. A local account transfer in GBP arrives in seconds! 

The ACH routing number for USD accounts is not yet available, but we plan to offer it soon! ✨

Why do I get a UK IBAN on a Local Currency account?
The foreign currency is not held in the Netherlands, but in the UK.

Can I receive all kinds of currency payments on my Local Currency account?
You can only receive payments in the same currency, so for example a USD payment to your USD account.

Can I do a Direct Debit on my Local Currency account?
We are constantly updating our product and adding features, and this one is on the list, but not available yet!

Can I receive payments from all sources of funds?
To keep the Local Currency safe and responsible, not all sources of funds are allowed. The following sources are restricted for funding a Local Currency account:

Businesses related to weapons
Multi-level marketing
Pawnbrokers
Political organisations 
Precious metals and stones
Adult entertainment
Drug paraphernalia
CBD and related products 
Carbon credits
Crypto currencies
Gambling
Ponzi / pyramid schemes
Firms involved in the servicing of illegal goods/services including but not limited to: counterfeit goods/trademark infringement, human trafficking, child labor, prostitution.

What happens if money comes in from a restricted source or in a currency that’s not supported?
When you receive money in an unsupported currency, or when the money comes from one of the above sources, the funds are returned to the sender. 🚀

Are there gonna be more currencies?

Absolutely yes! And this is where you can be heard - please make sure to vote for the local currency you want to see in our app next right here 💪

3,Spanish IBANs Service Coverage 🇪🇸,"['Updates', 'Knowledge', 'Featured', ""What's New?"", 'Spain']","Hey bunqers! 🌈

As you know with bunq Update 18 we announced the exciting launch of  Spanish IBANs. We’re more than happy to announce that as of 9th of September, you’ll be able to open your first Spanish sub-account by following the process explained here

Spanish Service Coverage 🏦

With the launch of every international branch, we introduce to you, we always make sure to double-check the service coverage across other banks. The majority of Spanish banks have accepted and successfully added our Spanish IBANs to their lists for cooperation. However, there are still some banks that don’t recognize our Spanish IBANs at the moment:

Santander
BBVA
Evo Banco
Imagin Bank
CaixaBank

What does that mean?

This means that you won’t be able to receive and make payments to the banks mentioned above for now. But worry not - we’re working on it and we’ll keep you updated. 

I have issues with other local banks, not mentioned above, what do I do?

Please make sure to contact our Support Team and let us know so that we can investigate this for you. 🚀

Also, make sure to contact the other bank to inform them regarding this issue so they can help us fix that faster!

4,bunq Update 18 FAQ 📚,"['Updates', 'Knowledge', 'Features', ""What's New?""]","bunq Update 18 FAQ 📚

Hey bunqers! 🌈 

With the exciting bunq Update 18, here comes a new FAQ. Check out all the details regarding new features that make life easy: 

1. Overview of bunq Update 18

What's new with the latest bunq Update?

With this Update we made sure to focus on two main actionables: provide you with a better local banking experience and improve the app. Now you can add a local European IBAN to your existing bunq account and our Spanish users can get a Spanish IBAN for the best local experience 💸

You can check the most important questions below so that you can learn more on how to bank like a local and also how to use the improved features we prepared for you. 

Make sure to check out the rest of features we prepared for you here ✨

2. Bank like a local

What’s Local IBAN and how do I use it 

To bank like a local, you need a local IBAN. Now you can create your own local IBAN while you keep your Dutch IBAN. Learn more about this here. 

And how does the Local IBAN invoicing work?

When you apply for a foreign sub-account, we have to run some more checks and this can include an additional verification to comply with the local regulations. This is why we charge our personal users  a small one-time fee of €9,99 and business users - €29.99. This fee is applied for each Local branch you choose. 

How does the Local currencies BETA feature work?

If you’re among the first 100 users, you’ll get access to the Local Currencies feature and can report bugs and suggest improvements during the BETA period.  

While you’re using the Beta feature, we’d love to hear your feedback, as well as any bugs you might run into. You can learn more on how to get your BETA version now here

How can I get a Spanish IBAN as a Spanish resident?

Simply open a new sub-account or visit the address settings to get started 🙌
You can check more info on how to get your Spanish IBAN easily here

Can I keep using my existing NL IBANs when I get my Spanish IBAN?

When switching to Spanish IBANs as a Spanish resident this will automatically apply to all your new sub-accounts. However you’re free to keep using your existing Dutch IBANs as usual! 🇪🇺

Is it mandatory to switch to ES IBANs for Spanish residents?

You can keep bunqing as usual with your Dutch IBANs. Looking for Spanish IBANs at a later moment? 🇪🇸 Simply visit the address settings to get started

3. Improved App

What’s new with the Profile tab?

Have access to everything you need easily! Now on the Profile tab you can see your Trophies, exclusive Deals that save you money, Tribes, Add-ons and Common Goals. All with a new and cleaner design. We moved the Events to the Home tab for your convenience. 📲

Never miss a direct debit! How direct debit reminders work?

To make sure that you always accept the direct debits in time we will make sure to send you a reminder that this payment request is about to expire 💌
You can choose to either always accept your direct debits or accept them manually. Learn more about how to set this up here

Let me show you how it works!

Our app is intuitive and our Together pages are always updated but sometimes a little hand from our support team is required! We are here to show you exactly how to find what you need. For more details about it check this topic

App search? How can I search through the app?

On any tab in the app you will see our magical search bar✨
Get to any feature, setting or payment in no time, simply by starting a search from anywhere in your bunq app. 

If you have an iOS device - simply scroll down the screen and the search bar will appear. If you have an Android device - click on the 🔎  button everywhere across the app.

5,"Phishing and Spoofing - The new ways of scamming, explained 👀",['Knowledge'],"We always aim to keep you and your funds safe so that you can enjoy the best banking experience. However, sometimes there are things that are out of our control. That’s why we want to make sure you’re aware of scamming techniques, and know how to stay protected.

Our legal department has provided us with a list of pro tips on how to recognize attempts of phishing and spoofing and how to react so that legal actions are taken on time. 

❗️ A list of known scammer websites can be found at the bottom of this page ❗️

Phishing

Phishing is a form of fraud where the scammer will send communication (emails, texts, messages over social media) impersonating reputable companies. The purpose of this is to trick you into sharing your personal details such as passwords, account details, and card numbers.

The main forms of phishing are described here

By getting to know phishing methods you can avoid getting tricked into providing any sensitive data regarding your account.

Spoofing

Scammers have been known to trick their victims by sending fraudulent links via SMS or Whatsapp. These messages are made to seem as if they’re coming explicitly from our bunq telephone number. 

The SMS/Whatsapp message contains a confirmation link or another link which may seem to have something in common with bunq such as a keyword. You will find screenshots of examples below:





Please make sure not to click on anything sent by someone who's pretending to be us regardless of the way the link has been sent - SMS/Whatsapp message or email. It’s best to contact our support team via one of the following ways:

via Support centre through your own account or by clicking here
via support@bunq.com 

Another version of ""spoofing"" is when you receive a message about a potential breach of your account, followed by a phone call from someone who's pretending to be our employee. The person will call you pretending to help secure your account by providing your security code during the conversation or by instructing you to click on some of the links that have been already sent to you via SMS/Whatsapp message and/or email.

bunq will not call you via the phone. If you have any doubts of the message/call's legitimacy, please do not provide any sensitive data to the respective person and contact us through the in-app chat or use support@bunq.com.


Fraudulent verification requests on Marktplaats

Scammers are currently active on Marktplaats and approach unsuspecting sellers or buyers via WhatsApp with so-called verification requests. What will actually happen:

You are selling something on Marktplaats;
Scammer pretends they wanna buy it;
Scammer convinces you via chat that you need to click on a verification link and give them the 6-digit code you receive in order for the payment to go through;
You  click on the link, give out the 6 digits  and lose access to the account. 

You can learn more about this frequent criminal behaviour here


Please be informed that the only way we're communicating with our users is via our in-app chat and official channels for communication, hence make sure to double-check if the text message is coming from an official source. Even then, please make sure to double-check the information provided there and if you have any doubts regarding its legitimacy, don’t hesitate to contact us through our Support Centre.

No institution, bank, or third party should ever request your unique credentials or access code to enter the bunq app. If someone is approaching you with a similar request, please be alert, as this is most likely fraud.

Other types of fraud have been explained here, so please make sure to double-check the information and help us keep you and the world safe.

6,Easily rent a car with your bunq credit card 🚗,"['Knowledge', 'Frequently Asked Questions', ""What's New?""]","Hey bunqers 🌈

Lots of you are using rental car services. We’ve had a few reports of issues with the payment authorization at car rentals when using your bunq card. 

bunq credit cards were not accepted by some car rental companies, because the companies used their own special way of charging for their services. This didn’t comply with Mastercard’s and EU’s regulations. 

We have great news for you! We’ve been working with Mastercard to solve this issue and from now on all bunq users can easily rent a car anywhere 🚗

In some cases, you may want to get a refund for a card payment. No worries, we’re here to help you! 🙌

Important Note: Don’t forget to check our tips on How to recognize fraud and stay safe
Do you not recognize the payment and suspect that your account has been fraudulently charged? Please click here



What is a Refund?

A Refund (a.k.a chargeback) is a form of purchase protection by Mastercard. In the case of disagreement between you and the merchant, you can formally dispute the payment via the Mastercard card scheme.



How can I get a Refund?

Firstly, always make sure to contact the merchant directly after you’ve noticed the transaction that needs a refund. In most cases the refund is done by the merchant and the whole process takes a couple of business days. 

Most merchants would happily assist you in correcting the charge and returning your money. That is why before using Mastercard purchase protection, we ask you to settle your dispute with the merchant.

Please make sure to share your order reference details with the merchant, to make sure their support team understands your situation correctly, and can provide you with the right solutions.

✅ As a tip, we always advise you to contact them by chat or e-mail so you have the transcript of your communication with them!




Card payment refunds from the app:

Follow the steps below to see how you can request a refund in the app:


Home
Tap on Total
Select your payment
Tap on (...) More
Tap on 🟣 Get help with this payment 

As a bank, we are obligated to provide the merchant who charged you with 7 days in which to respond to your claim and take the needed actions.

That is why if the method with requesting a refund from the app did not help in your case, we kindly ask you to reach out to the merchant that charged you, to ask them if they can help you with a refund. 

We are required to give the merchant a fair opportunity to directly help you with a refund.  This is important because we need to hear both sides of the story, whilst making sure that you are denied assistance and resolution from the third party, before we take matters into our own hands.

As mentioned above, please make sure to share your order reference details, to make sure the company’s support team understands your situation correctly, and can provide you with the right solutions. 

✅ As a tip, we always advise you to contact them by chat or an e-mail so you have the transcript of your communication with them!



Card payment refund at the terminal or Retourpinnen

Especially in The Netherlands it's common to receive a refund for a purchase made at a physical store by inserting your card at the payment terminal. If you made the original payment with that card it will work flawlessly.

👩🏻‍🏫 Pro tip: Make sure that the card is entered with the chip into the payment terminal for best results.



When can I request a refund and what do I need to do?

If the payment was made with your Maestro Debit card

Maestro payments are not covered by Mastercard purchase protection, we therefore cannot submit a chargeback request. In this case you should contact the merchant for further assistance and details on your refund request. 🔎
Do you suspect a transaction error was made with your Maestro card? Please contact our support)

If the payment was made with your Mastercard

Mastercard payments are covered by the Mastercard purchase protection. But we can only start the chargeback process if the merchant was unable or unwilling to help you. You should contact the merchant for assistance and details on your refund request first, before we can help you.

In case of a chargeback process, there are some additional details which are good-to-know:

Please give the merchant 7 business days to respond to your refund request.
Have your goods not arrived? Please give the merchant 30 days to deliver your goods.
Did the merchant agree to refund you? Please give the merchant at least 15 business days to process the refund.
Are you requesting a refund for ordered goods or services? Please upload a detailed description of the goods or service (preferably an order confirmation) in the refund request.
Did you have any communication with the merchant? Please upload screenshots of this in the refund request.

For more tips you can check the paragraph above. 


If the payment was an ATM transaction 🏧

ATM transactions are covered by Mastercard protection. Did you not receive your money from the ATM machine?- Request refund in app.

For ATM disputes there is no need to contact the merchant first. You can directly request a refund in the app as mentioned above. 



What if the merchant is not responding or is unwilling to refund the charge?

We always ask our users to reach out to the merchant that charged them to resolve the issue. However, sometimes the merchant might not respond or might refuse to help. 

Do not worry though, as we are here to help you! 🌈

If after 7 days the merchant hasn’t replied to your request, or if they informed you that they are not willing to help you with a refund, you can contact us with the details of the dispute and a copy of the communication with the merchant. This way, we will be able to look into the possibility of initiating a refund from our side.

If this happens, please reach out to our Support Center and send a message with the following:
Describe the information and provide all relevant information (date and time of the transaction, issue with the item/service, payment events)
Provide Screenshots of your communication with the merchant
Attach any documents that you find relevant to the case (invoice, terms &amp; conditions of the merchant, etc.)

It is important to give as much information as possible, as we need it in order to help you with your refund!

If you need a refund for a payment that you do not recognise, you can find more useful info at this page.



What happens next

Once the one-week period has passed and you have provided us with proof of communication and all relevant documents, we can proceed with performing the refund ourselves.


It is important to note that the merchant might still be able to dispute the refund within 45 days, please check our pricing sheet for more information about incidental costs. Our team will remain at your disposal to help you throughout the whole process. 👍



Things worth knowing about when requesting a card payment refund

For merchants that are impacted by Covid-19, this 7-day response time is extended to 15 days.

The process of reviewing your claim and processing with the refund may take from 1 to 12 business weeks. Depending on the individual case, different steps may be taken within the process.

It is important to note that the merchant might still be able to dispute the refund within 45 days.  Our team will remain at your disposal to help you throughout the whole process. 👍

 In this case please contact us immediately so you can look for a solution for you. 



How do I know if I received the refund?

We've simplified refunds so going forward, all new refunds you’ll receive will be shown as an incoming event at the top of your timeline. This will make it very simple to see where your money went, and when it came back to you.

You can also export a bank statement to verify if you’ve received the refund correctly.



What Can’t be Refunded?

Refunds are not possible for the following types of payments:

Bank transfers
iDEAL &amp; SOFORT payments
Wise payments (ex TransferWise)
B2B direct debits
the transaction concerns a deposit into an investment or crypto currency account
the transaction involves or has been executed via e-money wallet (like PayPal or Curve card)
the transaction concerns a donation (i.e., a payment to a charity)
the transaction was executed on a gambling or betting website.

Because we process these payments instantly, their systems do not allow us to request refunds for you after the payment was made. 

If you're looking for a refund for one of these options, we recommend directly requesting it from the other party.

14,When will I receive my payment?,"['Knowledge', 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'Payments']","
Bank transfers between banks in the SEPA Region usually take 1 or 2 business days to arrive at the recipient. 

When you send a payment from your bunq account, we will process it right away and send it to the receiving bank. It can then take a couple of days for the payment to be processed into the receiving bank account.
When you expect a payment to arrive from another bank, as soon as we receive the payment from the sending bank we will immediately process it and add it to your balance.

To learn about Instant Payments check out this page.

For more details regarding the expected arrival time of your transfer, check the information below. 👇



Sending a payment
When you send a payment from your bunq account,  an estimated arrival time is displayed for the transfer. You can see this within your payment confirmation screen.

SEPA

It usually takes 1-2 working days for a SEPA bank transfer to be processed by the receiving bank and appear on the recipient's bank account. However, in some cases, the receiving bank determines when the money is credited to the beneficiary account. We have no influence over when payments to other banks will effectively be credited on the beneficiary account. 
📌 Note: Transactions done after 15:25 on a weekday will be processed on the next working day.
If the payment is not received after 2 working days, you can export a transaction confirmation and share it with the receiving bank, to allow the receiving bank to locate the payment in their systems and process it correctly.
Payments between banks supporting SEPA Instant Payments and participating in the RT1 or TIPS system will arrive instantly on the recipient's bank account. To learn more about Instant Payments check out this page.

Wise

The arrival time will depend on the amount and currency of the payment.
You can see an estimated arrival time within the payment event. Their website can give you some more info.



Receiving a payment
When a payment is sent to your bunq account from another bank, we will process it as soon as we receive it from the other bank. 

❗️ Please keep in mind that we can only accept payments in Euros. Payments in other currencies will bounce back to the sender. An easy solution to convert the payments in Euros is to use Wise, we explain more about it here

You can find estimated arrival times for the following types of payments:


bunq

Payments made between bunq accounts are always instant!
This also applies to bunq.me payments made with bunq payment, iDEAL, SOFORT, Bancontact and credit or debit card top up. You can find more information on how to deposit funds to your account here.

SWIFT

May take up to 1 week due to processing times of the other bank.
We recommend using Wise instead (as it's faster and cheaper).
We can only process SWIFT payments into your account when we receive the payment in EURO currency. Make sure that the sending bank takes care of the conversion if the initial payment is made in another currency. Contact the sending bank in case you require help. Learn more about receiving SWIFT payments here.
Click here for more information on receiving payments outside the SEPA region.

SEPA

Instant for banks that participate in Instant Payments with RT1 or TIPS. You can check out the participants here.
All other banks may take 1-2 working days.
If the payment is not received after 2 full working days, you can contact the sending bank to check on the status of the payment. You can also request the Payment Transaction ID, to allow bunq to locate the payment and process it correctly.

29,Make cash deposits easily with PaysafeCash 💸,"['Knowledge', 'Features', ""What's New?""]","Hey bunqers 🌈

We always work towards making life easy. And what way to make it easier than safe and fast deposits for your account? That’s why we’ve teamed up with PaysafeCash and now you can use their services with just a few clicks in the app. Read below to see how. 



How does it work?

Simply create a deposit in the app by clicking on “Add money”. The first time you do this, we create a Paysafe account for you. If you have an account already, you can use the credentials to log in. 🚀

If you don't have an account already, when you first land on the PaysafeCash screen, click on the register button.

When you want to make a deposit, we create a Paysafe barcode for you. The barcode can be downloaded as PDF, added to a wallet, or sent as SMS or e-mail. Of course, you can also find it again in the app. 

You can use the barcode to deposit your cash at any of the supported stores. These will also show up in your app on the map. Find a store nearby and ask at the counter about the deposit. 

The staff will help you make the deposit by scanning the barcode. Right after, the money will be credited to your bunq account. 💸

This feature is now available in Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.

For our users in Italy, Germany and Austria, you can check our Barzahlen Cash Deposit feature here. 💪



Fees and limits

Fees

With this feature, you can deposit up to €100,00 free of charge. After this limit has been passed the deposit fee is 2.5%

Limits

Minimum (per deposit): €10.00
Maximum (per deposit): €250.00
Daily limit: €500.00
Monthly limit: €2000.00
Yearly limit: €5000.00

The limits apply for both personal and business users.



FAQ

 The staff doesn’t know how to deposit my money, what should I do?

If the staff of the store is unsure how to complete the deposit for you, there’s a button on the deposit screen that opens instructions for the staff ✨

There’s a store in the system that doesn’t exist anymore, what now? 

In cases where the store is closed or doesn’t exist at all, please make sure to report the store  to us via the in-app Support Center. We’ll make sure to report the case right away to PaySafe so that we can update our database accordingly.

With bunq, you save money on conversion when spending abroad by getting the real exchange rate. Soon you’ll also be able to receive, convert, hold and spend in multiple foreign currencies without having to leave your bunq app with Local Currencies. 

To enable this we need to create and maintain a complex network of branches, entities and partnerships that come at a significant cost. Additionally we need to cover the risk of currency fluctuations whilst the FX markets are closed. To cover these costs we’re introducing a ‘Network fee’ of 0.5%. 

How does that apply to me?

The network fee applies to currency exchange services. ZeroFX will continue to give the real exchange rate for all our Easy Money and Easy Green users. This applies to all card payments and the newly introduced currency conversions from the bunq app. Here’s a more detailed explanation on how the Network fee will work: 

Card Payments
With card payments the Network fee is applied as it follows: 

Easy Bank ➡️ MasterCard FX fee 1.5% + Network fee 0.5%
Easy Money ➡️ Network fee 0.5%
Easy Green ➡️ Network fee 0.5%

Conversion in the bunq app

The Network fee is applied to all conversions in the bunq app regardless of your plan.

We want to address this and give you some further information on the phishing reports we have received to make you aware and avoid falling victim to the scam.



What is phishing? 🎣
Phishing is a form of fraud where the scammer will send communications (emails, texts, messages over social media) pretending to be from reputable companies or institutions to trick you into sending money or sharing your personal details (such as passwords, account details and card numbers).

For more information on phishing and how to prevent being phished have a look at this topic.



Phishing reports concerning bunq
We have received reports about a website pretending to be bunq. Make sure you do not enter any of your personal data via links received via SMS. This website uses the following phishing text messages to steal your login credentials: 

Latest phishing SMS reported:

Vanwege veiligheidsredenen zijn wiz genoodzaakt om uw bunq account te actualiseren: https://bunq-update17.club/3.php

Make sure that you do not click on the link you receive via SMS and do not share any personal information. You can always verify the security of your bunq account in the bunq app.



What will happen next

We are aware and have reported the scam to our internal team. They are currently taking the required actions to keep everyone safe. 👍



Keeping your bunq account secured

To verify that your bunq account is secured, you can follow these steps:

go to Security to change your login code.
go to Security and tap on ""Devices"". From there, delete any device that you do not recognise.
go to Profile and tap on your name. From there, delete any phone number or email address that you do not recognise.



Was there a security breach at bunq?

No, your data is safe at bunq. Privacy and security are our top priorities. This means we will never share your personal data to third parties without your permission. You can learn more here.

Scammers performing phishing scams will send the same SMS to huge amounts of random phone numbers. It happens that some of those receiving the SMS will also have an account at bunq.

The phishing SMS appears as sent from bunq, since anyone can send an SMS which will show ""bunq"" (or any other company) as the sender, with some tools available on the internet. This is known as spoofing.
For this reason, we advise to always open the bunq app yourself, and to not open links you receive via SMS or email.



Do you need to report something? 🌈
You can report phishing websites here. If it's a fraudulent user, you can help keep bunq safe. Simply send an email to report@bunq.com and we’ll take it from there.

Hey bunqers 🌈

Local IBANs are here, and they’re the perfect fit for your international lifestyle. Easily add and use IBANs from multiple European countries - all in your bunq app. Easy Money Personal and Easy Green Personal users can start exploring this feature. 😎

Local IBANs are a perfect solution if you need to establish a local presence abroad for your personal and business account. For instance, when you’re doing business in multiple countries, travel often to the same place or plan to go abroad for a while to study or work . 

How do I create a Local IBAN

Go to the Home Tab
Press on the + Add Accounts
Select Local IBAN
Click on “Get a Local IBAN”
Choose your new IBAN
Verify your identity if needed and you’re good to go 🎉

 


How do I verify in order to get my Local IBAN?

Please keep in mind that we may ask you to verify your identity again to get a local IBAN. But no worries, you can do this in minutes from your phone as we explain here. 🤳 

When you apply for a foreign sub-account, we have to run some more checks and this can include an additional verification to comply with the local regulations. This is why we charge our personal users  a small one-time fee of €9,99 and business users - €29.99. This fee is applied for each Local branch you choose. 

For example: for your first opened German IBAN you’ll be billed €9,99 and every next German IBAN has no additional fee. Then if you choose to open a French IBAN, you have to pay the same fee again under the same regulation.

Good-to-knows 📌

There are a couple of changes to our current plans. As you can see, we have a new plan in the mix (Easy Bank) and two discontinued - Easy Travel and +1. What does that mean to you?

Easy Travel is discontinued

As of June 1st, you won’t be able to get an Easy Travel plan or switch to it. 
If you have a current ongoing Easy Travel plan, you can stick with it until your Active Travel Card expires. If you’re an Easy Travel user without a card, you can keep your Easy Travel plan for now. In case you want to order a new bunq card, you’ll need to upgrade your plan to a new one. Also keep in mind that if you decide to change your plan, you won’t be able to go back to Easy Travel. 

+1 is upgraded to Easy Bank

As of June 1st our +1 plan will be discontinued. All +1 users will be automatically moved to our new plan - Easy Bank (learn more about this plan here - which means that no additional charges will be billed. The only thing that’s changing here is the owner of the account which in this case will be you. The amount you’re billed stays the same, the only difference is that we’re charging your account directly from now on.

For +1 employees, the price remains the same. The only difference is that now billing will be made from your account, but the sub-account remains shared so you still have access to it as before.

Free cards included in your plan

As an Easy Bank user, you can get 1 physical card for free (excluding Metal Card). You can  order extra cards for a one time 9.99 EUR and 3.49 EUR fee per month. Virtual cards aren’t included in your plan.
If you are an Easy Money or Easy Green user, you can have 3 active physical cards for free (excluding the Metal Card).  You can order extra cards for 9.99 EUR one-time and 3.49 EUR fee per month. Virtual cards are included in your plan, without extra fees.

 I have a pre-paid plan, what now?

All users who prepaid before bunq Update 17 get the old pricing, so worry not - there’s no extra invoice for you.

 Can I still prepay with the old price?

If you have had a paid plan activated before June 1st, you can still pre-pay with the old price before the 1st of August 2021.
If you signed up after bunq Update 17, you can pre-pay with the new pricing.
You can find the new update pricing list here

What happens if I downgrade to Easy Bank after the Easy Green trial?

You can keep one card of your choice and one sub-account. You can keep the other cards to use in the future if you decide to upgrade your account.

For these and other improvements, update your app today! 🏃‍♂️

Stay tuned for more exciting updates and features in the future!

We’ve rolled out a new update to our app that includes small new improvements and features that will make your life easy.



iOS

What’s fixed 🔨

We’ve fixed a lot of bugs that caused the bunq app to crash, like getting an “out of memory” error, or trying to edit a custom amount when splitting the bill. All good now!

Your balance was no longer hidden when scrolling through sub-account transactions, even if you picked “hide balance”. Fixed that!

Sometimes ordering a new card in the app would show you the incorrect price. We’ve taken care of that.

Sometimes you couldn’t provide the necessary information through the app, when onboarding as a company. We fixed that.



Android

What’s fixed 🔨

You couldn’t see blocked sub-accounts and their transaction history in your business account. Now you can!

59,bunq - How to save money traveling ✈️,"['Knowledge', 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'Tips']","Hey bunqers! 🌈

Holidays are meant to be a time to disconnect from your problems and relax 💆🏻‍♀️For the explores, traveling is always the goal. Walk around unknown streets, listen to a different language and try foods you've never tasted before. All that comes with a cost and that’s  the part of the trip no one likes to think about.

Fortunately you don’t have to! We thought about everything so you can do the impossible: save money on your next trip! 🤑

Once your payment is confirmed by the merchant, the amount will be adjusted based on the latest currency conversion rate.
 


bunq Deals

We're always up for some good deals and we share them all with you. You can take advantage of them from your app. Head to the Profile tab and press on “Money saved” to see the bunq Deals. Here’s a little preview:

Travel assistant

Travel Assistant lets you know: 

A simple and easy-to-read overview of the exchange rate
Don’t worry about memorizing exchange rates. We’ll give you a reminder
Whether or not you have enabled card payments for the country of your destination
This topic can walk you through how to do this.
Which bunq card you should use
Some countries prefer Maestro, some Mastercard. Now you won’t have to remember which.
If other bunqers have been there before
Learn from their experiences so you know what to expect when you arrive.

Find out how much a beer costs or on which side of the road to drive. All travel tips are here!

You can also enable location-based push notifications, so you can be an expert on your destination as soon as you land! 🛬 

For these notifications we use geofences! This means that your device detects when you get to an airport and automatically alerts the bunq app of your arrival (so your location will not be logged in the app). If you then have Travel Assistant notifications enabled in the app, you’ll receive a push notification to give you travel tips before and after your departure into a new country.

62,bunq Tips: How to avoid overspending 💸,"['Knowledge', 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'Features', 'Tips']","Hey bunqers! 

Between rent, health insurance, parties and bars reopening we all know how hard it is to stay on budget. One of our missions is to help you get the financial stability that you need to live life on your terms!

First step in taking control of your finances is understanding where the money is going 🧐 We can help with that! 



Merchant overview

Are you often going to the same store, same café, same gym? Want to know how much money you spend there? In the Home tab, choose your account, and select the merchant icon in the payment details screen to see a clear overview of all the payments made to them. It’s that simple ⚡️

This way you can see how every purchase affects your budget and adapt your spending habits to meet your savings goals.




Daily limits



Overspending can easily happen when having fun. We’ve all been there...but there’s a trick for that!

Setting your daily limits will help you plan upfront how much you want to spend. 💸 We explain here what your daily limits are and how to change them.



Account visibility

We can’t spend the money that we don’t know we have - once said a known greek philosopher. A good trick to avoid spending the money that you wanna save is to hide the account so you don’t count on that money. This way you can only see the account that shows the balance you plan to spend. 📲

You can easily choose the accounts that you wanna see on the Home page by going to the Profile tab, pressing on the ⚙️ Settings button and then choosing 🟦 Visibility.

You can also hide the account where you are saving money from AutoSave You will be surprised by how much money you can save while you are spending!

Using your card
💳 Do I need cash in Poland, or can I use my card everywhere?

64,ATM Withdrawal Limit Update 🏧,"['Knowledge', ""What's New?""]","Hey bunqers 🌈

During bunq Update 17, we've noticed that the need for cash has decreased as people embraced safe and contactless payments. When looking at the usage of bunq cards, we noticed that most of you withdraw less than €250 daily. On the other hand, withdrawals higher than €250 are mostly related to cases of fraud. We are required by law to prevent fraud. Despite a lot of legitimate uses, cash is also used for illegitimate businesses.

After we listened to your feedback, we increased the ATM withdrawal limit to €500 per day per person. Once you've had a bunq account for longer than 3 months, you can enjoy the new limit. 

The new ATM limit is applied on the 30th of July 2021.

Check them out below! 🌈 👇
  
Using your card
💳 Do I need cash in Greece, or can I use my card everywhere?
Nearly every business has a card terminal in Greece, but that doesn't always mean they will take your card.

Useful things to know
💁‍♀️ How does tipping work?
Restaurants will normally include a service charge on the bill. This is about 16%, and is often not specified separately on the bill. It should be written somewhere on the menu, look for it towards the end with the other taxes.

When the service charge is added, you don't need to tip. Often people will still round up the bill to the nearest euro or two, if the service was good.

83,🇩🇪 Phishing scam: what is it and how to avoid it?,"['Knowledge', 'Germany']","Phishing scam: what is it and how can I avoid it? We have been made aware that there are ongoing phishing scams pretending to be bunq or other banks and requiring you to verify your bank details so they can steal them. We wanted to bring the matter up and give you more information and advice to avoid becoming a victim of fraud. What is phishing? 🎣 Phishing is a type of fraud in which the fraudster sends messages (emails, texts, messages via social networks) pretending to represent a well-known company. He then uses these messages to steal your personal information such as passwords, account details and card numbers. How do these scammers use bunq ? Phishing can be found in different forms. One of them would be the SMS messages or emails that pretend to be from us and tell you that something is wrong with your account and you should verify your username and password again. Alternatively, it can be a text message or email from a company telling you that you still have a certain “fee” to pay. How can I avoid becoming a phishing victim? 🙅‍♂️ Never give out your login details or personal information Bunq would never ask for personal information outside of the app and if someone pretends to be us and asks you for that information, it is a scam and you should definitely not give out personal information. Check the format and spelling of the messages If the format and spelling does not match the business web address it was supposed to be from, it is most likely a scam. Watch out for fake websites Always be sure that you are on bunq .app when entering your login details. Contact us via official channels If you get a mail from a source you recognize ( bunq 😊) but it seems a bit strange or not entirely okay with the message, contact us again separately to confirm that the message is authentic. This helps us to identify new scams. Be careful with your social media posts When you share things on the social networks, be careful with your personal information such as date of birth, vacation plans, address, mobile phone number, etc., as this information could often be useful to the scammers. Do you have to report something? 🌈 If it's a fraudulent user, you can help us keep bunq safe. Just fill out this form and we will do it from here. If you report a fraudulent user, please include their account number and any relevant information in your message.

84,🇩🇪 How to Spot Fraud and Stay Safe,"['Knowledge', 'Germany']","How to spot fraud and stay safe Hello bunqers! 🌈 As you know, bunq takes the security of your personal information very seriously. 🔒 We have already shared some tips on how you can protect yourself and your money here. However, we thought it might be helpful to provide more tips to help you spot fraud. Phishing What is phishing? Phishing is an attempt by scammers to get your personal information such as passwords or security information. The scammers often pretend to be a trustworthy organization using fake websites that look like legitimate websites. The general layout and the link are mostly almost exactly the same. These websites are very good at convincing you that they are sending real mail from (for example) your bank or an online payment processor when it is actually a scam. If you receive any email or other messages similar to normal bunq messages asking you to follow a link and log in or provide your login codes or other security information, please do not follow these instructions. bunq phone (we do not use phone calls as a means of communication), email, SMS, WhatsApp or any form of social media. If you don't trust a website or are unsure about it, you can always use tools like this to check it out. Here's a tip: if the website appears to have been recently registered, it may be an indication that the website is fake. See the topic below for more information. Old-school phishing This happens when you enter your PIN at an ATM or at a pay station. Please make sure that nobody is watching you and that you always hide your PIN while you are entering it. Then keep your passcode safe. WhatsApp scam WhatsApp scam is a form of scam in which someone pretends to know you and uses a WhatsApp message to ask you to help them pay a bill. As a rule, the following properties apply: The &quot;person you know&quot; has a new number and is contacting you via WhatsApp. She will ask you to help her by paying a bill for her. Usually the person is in a hurry, the bill has to be paid quickly; She cannot or does not want to communicate with you in any other way than Whatsapp. If someone asks you to transfer money or pay an existing bill, please always contact them using other means of communication outside of Whatsapp. If you cannot reach this person, please do not transfer any money. How could you help stop these types of scams? If the fraudster provided a link, you should IBAN or the link to the police and the relevant bank. Fake payment requests When you receive a payment request, always check the authenticity of the website to which the link leads. Fraudsters often use fake websites that look very similar to a bank's normal payment environment, but the website is a fake one. The information you enter in this payment request is directly visible to the fraudsters and can be used to access your bank account. Never enter your details if you don't trust the payment link or the person sending you the payment request. Marketplace fraud There are many times that the item you are looking for can be found on used goods websites. That's great! Second-hand goods are cheaper and reusing products helps make the world greener. Unfortunately, sometimes the person won't deliver the product after you've paid for it. How do you recognize such fraudsters? First of all, we want to emphasize that if it sounds too good to be true, it is usually because it is not real. Always check the market value of the product you want to buy. If the price of the product on offer is too low, it could be a sign that a scammer is at work. Don't become a cash cow! If someone approaches you asking for access to your bank account or wants to transfer money through your bank account, never follow this prompt, no matter how promising it sounds! Here's an example: someone contacts you on social media or friends and promises you a sum of money. The person promises you this money when you send money for them or when they can use your bank account for a few days. She will tell you that there is no risk and that it is really easy money. It is very likely that your bank account will be used for criminal activity for which you would be (criminally) liable. As a result, you may not be able to open bank accounts, take out a mortgage or obtain a loan, and possibly criminal proceedings. Please note here that if something sounds too good to be true, it is usually because it is not true. You can find more information about money mules on this website of the Dutch police. What to do if you become a victim or suspect fraud? Check your bank account regularly and always read your bank mail quickly after receiving it. If you have become a victim of scammers, contact your bank sofort If you suspect fraud, please inform your bank of the suspicion. The form for reporting suspected fraud or fraud at bunq can be found here. Do you want to know more?

It is perfectly normal for you to get mad. However, it is very important to remember that you have the power to help yourself and also to help prevent future falls. We published this article so that you can understand what should be done if you are a victim of fraud. I was betrayed, what should I do now? - Report it to your bank's customer service Provide any existing details of the fraud and fraudulent transaction. The data that you should share is the data of the fraudulent transaction (name of the sender, IBAN the sender, name of the recipient, IBAN the recipient, amount, date, etc).

For example in the Netherlands you could report these types of incidents online here. Will I be able to get a refund? Refunds from your bank or a court ruling for fraud are possible, but it is important to follow the correct procedure. As described above, the most important thing is to report the incident to your bank and the police. Both groups can help you through different processes. - The police The police can initiate a criminal investigation thanks to the report. The criminal investigation could lead to a lawsuit for the fraudster and a judge can then order the fraudster to reimburse the victims for everything. - your bank Your own bank has the option of contacting the fraudster's bank through a special channel and checking whether there is an option to get the money back.

86,What’s a safekeeping fee and why is it necessary?,"['Knowledge', 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'Bank account']","Since the beginning of bunq, we’ve actively chosen a different approach to traditional banking by not investing your money in nasty businesses. Instead, you can choose what we invest in with Freedom of Choice or store it as safe and clean as possible at the European Central Bank. Because storing your money safely at the European Central Bank comes with substantial costs we need to make sure it’s sustainable for both you and us.

What is the Safekeeping Fee?

In order to continue keeping your money safe, as of 1st of March 2021, we’ve introduced the following updated pricing terms for our safekeeping fee:

For balances of over €100,000, we have a fee of 4 cents per day, per €1000 (rounded down) for any funds above the €100.000 limit.

For balances of over €1.000.000, we charge a fee of 6 cents per day, per €1000 (rounded down) for any funds above the €1.000.000 limit.

Let us give you a few examples!



Examples for accounts with balance between €100,000 and €1,000,000 💸

If you have €100,000 in your bunq account (total of all sub-accounts): there is NO Safekeeping fee, since this is below the minimum amount for it. 

If you have €105,700 in your bunq account: 
 You would be charged €0.04 (4 euro cents) per any extra €1,000 that you have above the €100,000. This means that you get charged a fee only for €5,700 which gets rounded to €5,000. The safekeeping fee for your balance of €105,700 would be 5 x €0.04 = €0.2/ per day.



Example for accounts with balance above €1,000,000 💰

If you have €1,100,000 in your bunq account: 

 Your first €100,000 would be with no Safekeeping fee
 For any €1,000 between €100,000 and €1,000,000 you are charged €0.04. In this case - 900 x 0.04 = €36/per day.
 For any €1,000 above €1,000,000 you are charged €0.06. In this case - 100 x 0.06 = €6/per day.
 This means that the total safekeeping fee for your balance of €1,100,000 would be 36+6 = €42/per day

You can find more detailed information about our Safekeeping fees as well as the pricing of other services in our pricing sheet. 🏷

88,BU17 FAQ 📚,"['Updates', 'Knowledge', 'Features', ""What's New?""]","bunq Update 17 FAQ 📚

Hey bunqers! 🌈 

New update, new FAQ. Check out all the details regarding new plans and features that make life easy: 

1. Overview of bunq Update 17

What's new with the latest bunq Update?

To smoothen your experience, we've improved the bunq essential features by making them easier to access. Pay and Request are just a tap away, adding sub-accounts and ordering new cards is now easy as ABC and you can quickly find anything you need with a dedicated search bar. 

From now on, you can simply open an SOS chat through the app or call our number in cases of emergency.  🆘

Also you can get everything you would expect from a mobile bank plus signature bunq features, with a quick 5 minute setup with the new Easy Bank plan. 

You can now discover even more hot spots that you and your friends love with the new Friends 2.0.  

We’ve also made some additional changes to current plans. Learn more below. 🚀


2. Plans

What’s Easy Bank 

Easy Bank is our new plan that gives you access to the most important tools such as IBAN to IBAN transfers, a free card, SOS Support, Scheduled Payments and Requests, Joint Accounts, etc. Best part? You can set it up in just 5 minutes. The monthly fee for a personal account is €2.99 and you can learn more about this new cool plan here. 💸

What happened with Easy Travel

To provide you with the best banking experience out there, we’ve launched a brand new plan - Easy Bank - and discontinued the Easy Travel plan. We’ve designed this exciting plan to bring you the most essential and iconic bunq features, with the easiest setup.

From now on, you won’t be able to open an Easy Travel plan or switch to that plan. If you have a current ongoing Easy Travel plan, you can stick with it until your Active Travel Card expires. If you are an Easy Travel user without a card you can also stay with your Easy Travel plan, but when you want to order a new bunq card, you’ll need to choose a new plan. Keep in mind that if you decide to change your plan, you won’t be able to go back to Easy Travel.

What happened with +1

With the introduction of our newest plan that fits your needs, Easy Bank, we’ve also discontinued +1.

All +1 users will be automatically switched to our new plan - Easy Bank (learn more about this plan here. 

If you were a +1 and you had a shared account already, fear not, the shared account will remain active after the update too. The cost remains the same, but the billing will now be from your own, personal account. 

For +1 employees, the price remains the same. The only difference is that now billing will be made from your account, but the sub-account remains shared so you still have access to it as before.

I’m a Business Director and I need a free personal account

From now on the director who opens an Easy Money or Easy Green business account will have a free personal account if they don’t use any of our personal features. More than 3 directors? Every additional personal account for other directors, the business account will be invoiced 2.99 EUR per director. However, if you change your mind, you can always upgrade to a paid plan and enjoy all the cool features coming with it.

Child account changes

Creating an account for your child just got easier. 

From now you can invite your child by following this simple process: 

Open the bunq app
Head to the Community tab
Select “Invite a Friend - Get 10 trees by introducing your friend to bunq”
Click Invite Friends
Share your link!

You can learn more about this change here

When signing up and providing personal info, your child will be asked to mention their parent. You'll need to confirm you're allowing them to have the account. Once reviewed and approved by the bunq team, your child can enjoy their personal account.


Price Changes - what does that mean for me?

We're constantly working towards making life easy. That's why we’ve invested in new benefits and features that bring value to your everyday life. We've made some changes to Pricing that we'd like to share with you. 

Current bunqers get 2 months notice, meaning that the new prices will apply to you after 2 months. The fee for all current plans will increase with €1.00 each per month. More info can be found here

For bunqers-to-be, the new pricing applies right away. 

3. New Features

SOS Support

SOS? No sweat, we’ll help you in no time! Simply open an SOS chat through the app or call our number. Follow a few simple steps, and your issue becomes our nr. 1 priority - saving you time when you need it most. You can learn more about SOS Support here

Iraq is a cash driven society. Be sure to withdraw enough cash ahead of time.


💰 What currency do they use here?
The currency here is Iraqi dinar. The symbol is ع.د or IQD.


🏧 Which ATM’s can I use for free?
The bunq community hasn't reported reported any free ATM's here yet. If you find one, help other bunqers by sharing it here!






💵 If I want cash, how much should I take out of an ATM?
250 000 IQD should be enough for a few days.


💳 Should I choose local currency or Euros when paying?
If you're asked to choose between local currency and Euros, always choose local currency.

That way bunq does the conversion for you, and you get to take advantage of the best rates with bunq ZeroFX.
  
Staying connected
📱 Can I roam, or should I get a local SIM?

Wifi is readily available, especially in coffee shops.

Why did I receive an announcement to provide more information?

We are asking these questions because not all types of business activities are within our acceptance policy and we want to better understand what you are doing. This is in order to prevent possible unwanted restrictions on your account at a later point.  To do that, we aim to gather as much accurate and elaborate information as possible at the very start of your journey with bunq. 



How can I provide this information? 📲

Information events are the fastest way to save time when opening a bunq account! They serve as direct options for you to provide documents or information directly to us through your app. 
To find the events in the app, just follow the steps below:

Go to Home tab
Tap on Events awaiting
Select Business information  and tap on Awaiting business information

When you get a notification in the app, you can provide the additional information and expected passive income percentage (if you have any) directly to us! 🎉



Need further help?

If you have any other questions regarding your activities, check out this topic.

You can always send us an email directly to signup@bunq.com or contact Support from here, we'll be happy to help! 🙌

108, IBAN Discrimination - Report it now! ,['Knowledge'],"

🌍  IBAN Discrimination - How and where to report?

Hey bunqers! 🌈

Our job here at bunq is to empower you to be free and make your life easy. This is why we provide you extra security, easy and fast processes and fast support. But much too often, we started receiving more and more cases of IBAN discrimination. 

This happens especially when  businesses in the EU refuse to accept your IBAN because they need an IBAN from the country they're based in. This kind of discrimination is actually illegal. 

That’s why we join Wise, Klarna, N26, SumUp and Revolut in a fight against “IBAN discrimination”. And you can help us!

How can I help?

If you’re experiencing  IBAN discrimination, you can report your case on this platform: https://www.acceptmyiban.org/

Once you report the case there, we’ll do the job for you by passing your report to the responsible authorities. No need to think about which form you should choose, and all kinds of hassle, we handle it for you! 🙌


Know your rights

Like any other IBAN provided by a bank within the SEPA region (Single Euro Payment Area), your bunq IBAN should be accepted by merchants or employers, since European countries have agreed on this simplified IBAN system to facilitate international transfers within Europe.

This simply means that if merchants or employers don’t want to accept your bunq IBAN because of its country code, length or any other reason, they are violating European law as of 1 February 2016 (Article 9 of Regulation No 260/2012) and doing what we call IBAN discrimination.

138,3DS2 and Soft Declines,"['Knowledge', 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'Payments']","Online card payments are now more secure than ever! 

As of the 1st January 2021, new regulations have come into effect that aim to increase the safety and security of card payments all across Europe. These new regulations are part of Europe’s PSD2, which seeks to improve the security of payments, boost innovation and help banks across Europe with modernising and adapting to new services. As part of the process to continue to modernise and ensure the highest safety standards, 3DS2 was introduced. 



What is 3DS2?

3DS2 is a type of security feature known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) or two-step verification. This type of verification ensures that you, the card holder, are the one performing the payment and no one else 🥷 

We brought this security standard to our users in December 2020 and made sure that with bunq, it would be a quick and easy feature. With this new high-end security feature, users can authorise online card payments through a push notification from the bunq app. Once you’ve approved the purchase, you’re done! We’ve made it easier and faster than ever to approve your purchases 🙌



How do these rules impact me?
Luckily most of our users won’t notice the changes and can continue to do payments as usual ⭐️  In some rare cases, you might come across a failed card payment because the merchant doesn’t process the payment using the most recent and highest security standards. We believe in transparency, which is why we have implemented a text to notify you about online payments that failed because they didn’t meet that high security standard. 


As it’s required for us to decline these unsafe payments, you might encounter a failed payment for certain online transactions. We’re always looking for ways to improve your banking experience, but of course the safety of your money comes first 🔒  

If you encounter any problems, please reach out to our Support team.  


I have a failed payment, now what?

   Firstly, make sure that your payment was indeed denied due to 3DS2. To do so, go to your payment Event and check the reason for failure. It is right below the payment amount💲 

If you see Your payment was declined due to 3DS Secure Authentication failure then this is indeed a case of soft decline 👍 To adjust this in a few easy taps, simply enable Auto Accept and try again! The payment should be paid correctly this time 💪

Don’t know how to set up Auto Accept? Check out our tutorial here

153,Changes to your Slice Groups ,"['Updates', 'Knowledge', ""What's New?""]","


Hey bunqers! 🌈

A few years ago, we introduced Slice Groups. Slice Groups were created for you to set up a group directly from the bunq app to keep track of who paid what. We’re excited to see that you’ve been using this feature to keep track of group expenses and make life easy 🙌

Thanks to the feedback from bunqers, we’ve been inspired to make some amazing improvements to this feature. In order to make it happen, we need to take your Slice Group offline for a short while, so we can rebuild it completely into your new favourite bunq feature! 

What does this mean for you?
To ensure that you have the time to settle and close your active Slice Groups, you can still find these in your bunq app until the 19th of January 2021. After that, we will automatically settle and close any open groups you might have.

What’s next?
We look forward to sharing more about the improved, brand new feature with you soon! Keep your eyes on our socials and Together in the coming weeks to learn more about what’s coming next 🎉

In the meantime, our Circle of Trust  feature would be a great alternative to use! Simply add your friends to your Circle of Trust and the bunq app automatically approves their Payment Requests!

155,UK bunqers - we're pausing opening new accounts until further notice 🇬🇧,"['Knowledge', ""What's New?"", 'UK']","

Hey bunqers! 🌈 This notice is specific ONLY to our users in the UK 🇬🇧

With the end of 2020 fast approaching, we wanted to let our UK users know about some changes that are happening in 2021 🇬🇧 

With Brexit coming on January 1st, 2021, opening new bunq accounts from the UK will be temporarily paused. This means you won’t be able to start a new account using a phone number/address based in the UK. This includes all bunq plans, both personal and business.

We're working with the Bank of England Prudential Regulation Authority and waiting for the regulators to allow us to serve you again.

Current bunq users in the UK can continue using their bunq account as usual 🙌

If you already have a bunq account in the UK, nothing changes - you can continue using all of your products and cards.

Stay tuned to our social channels and Together - we’ll let you know when we’re ready for new UK users again!

156,🇩🇪 Geolocation and address confirmation explained,"['Knowledge', 'Germany']"," When you open an account with us, you will be given the opportunity to confirm your address. This article explains why we ask for this and need it, and how you can confirm your address. Why do I need to confirm my address? As a bank, we have to comply with various laws to protect you and your funds. In some cases, we may need to confirm an address either through geolocation or an official document. How does it work? There are several ways to verify an address. This gives us an opportunity to match your location with the address you entered when you registered. If that is not enough for us, we will ask you to send us additional documents as proof of your address. Which documents do we accept? So far we have accepted the following documents as proof of address: A residence permit that was issued less than 6 months ago Electricity bill for heating, water or electricity, not older than 3 months Rental agreements not older than 6 months Proof of registration with your municipality or a town hall, not older than 1 year Proof of enrollment in a school / university for the current school year What can I do if I don't have any of the documents listed above? We will only ask you for a document if we are legally obliged to do so. If you cannot provide us with the document, then we cannot open an account for you. We do not accept documents as proof of address such as: Bank statements Cell phone bills or other bills Employment contracts Proof of ownership Proof of temporary residence Address on an ID / passport Pay slips Please remember that we can only accept proof of address if the following information can be found on the document: your name the entire address the date of issue of the document your signature and this from the landlord on a rental agreement the company's logo on a bill for electricity, heating or water We can only accept photos of the original document or a PDF version of it. We understand that it can sometimes be difficult to forward new electricity bills to us because they may be in someone else's name, so you can always request a confirmation document from your address from your municipality or town hall. If you need to confirm your address, please contact the municipality and you will receive the relevant documents. What if I don't have any of the documents listed above? We ask you to send a document to us only if we are legally obliged to do so. If you cannot send a document, we cannot complete the verification of your account. As soon as we get the document, however, we will continue with the process. Would you like more information about opening an account?

157,Pro Tips for bunq Freelancers - Manage budgets effortlessly,"['Knowledge', 'Business Center', 'Tips']","We know that freelancing takes some serious skills, passion and time. That’s why we want to make your life easy and provide you with all of the helpful tools needed to be successful.
Here are some of our pro tips on how to bank like a true professional 💪



Track everything 👀

Whether you’re a freelance writer, coder or digital marketeer, your work is a small business. That means you need to keep track of everything. The bunq app makes it easy with Insights, where you’re able to see which categories you overspend and cut down on your budget if needed.

Insights will automatically show you an overview of your expenses and a breakdown of how much you have spent on general expenses, subscriptions, travel and more. You can access Insights through the Home screen in the app.

Based on your preference, you will be able to track your spending by calendar month or by pay cycle.

You can learn more about this here.



Plan out your spending habits 💸

Now that you know where you spend the most, plan in advance so that you can keep a tab on your spending. A great way to do this is by creating multiple sub-accounts based off of your usual spending habits and keeping some funds locked away for different purposes. This means that you can create accounts to keep track of your travel expenses, taxes, recurring costs or anything that fits your needs.

Did you know that within your bunq account you can have up to 25 sub-accounts with different IBANs? You can also personalize these the way you want! Isn’t that amazing? 🌈

You can see how to do so by clicking here. 



Save it for a rainy day ☔️

Freelancing is like living an adventure, which comes with unpredictability. Your earnings fluctuate often and that's why you may want to save money for dry spells. As a rule of thumb it’s always a good idea to have savings for 6-12 months covering your living costs. At bunq that’s easier than ever, thanks to Savings Goals. Simply create a goal for whatever you need and watch your progress grow!

Creating Savings Goals is really easy and fast. You just need to follow the process explained here

What’s new in App Update 15.8 ⚡️

Hey bunqers! 🌈

We’ve rolled out a new update to our app! We fixed some of the bugs you had reported to us, and we also included some small new app improvements. 

What’s new
iOS &amp; Android

You may notice that instead of the Action Menu, there's now a MENU button in your bunq app. This is because we've seen the previous version was tricky for many people. After a couple of tests and amazing feedback from you, the new design of the MENU button came on top. Thanks for always inspiring us to be better!  ❤️



Bugfixes

iOS 

When removing a sub-account from your Total tile, sometimes all payments from that sub-account were also removed from the Total overview. That’s fixed now! 🙌

If you have a merged business and tried to scan an invoice, it’s possible that you couldn’t complete the payment after you chose the user. All good now!⭐️

When trying to change the picture of your Tribe, you’d get an error message saying the name of your Tribe is already taken. We’ve fixed it! ✨

When trying to send money with TransferWise, a frozen screen would sometimes stop you from completing the transfer. That’s taken care of! 🌎



Android

Sometimes, you couldn’t attach an image to your chat with the support team. Fixed! 👏

The balance graph within your sub-accounts wasn’t always accurate and didn’t load the correct data. It’s all good now! 🙌

166,How to recognise fraud and stay safe,"['Knowledge', 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'Payments']","


Hi bunqers! 🌈

As you know, bunq takes the safety and security of your personal information very seriously 🔒 We’ve already shared some tips on how to keep you and your money safe here, but we thought it might help to provide some more tips to to help you recognize fraud.  


Phishing

What is Phishing? Phishing is an attempt by fraudsters to obtain your personal information, such as passwords or security details. The fraudsters often disguise themselves as a trustworthy party by using fake websites that look just like legitimate websites. The general lay-out as well as the link are often almost exactly the same. These websites are very good at making you believe they are sending a genuine email from (for example) your bank or an online payment processor, when in fact it is fake.

If you receive an email or other messages that resemble bunq’s normal messages, in which you are asked to follow a link and log in, or share your login codes or other security information, please do not follow these instructions.

bunq will never ask for your login codes or security features either by phone (we don’t use phone calls as a way of communication), via e-mail, text message, WhatsApp or any form of social media.

If you don’t trust a website or are unsure, you can always use tools such as this to check. Here’s a tip: If the website seems to be registered recently, this may be an indication that the website is fraudulent. For more information, check out the following topic.


Old-fashioned phishing

This happens when you are entering your PIN in an ATM or at a payment station. Please make sure that no one is watching you and that you always cover your PIN while you are entering it. Afterward, store your passcode safely.  


WhatsApp fraud

WhatsApp fraud is a form of fraud where someone pretends to be someone you know, and asks you to help them out with the payment of a bill through a Whatsapp message. Usually, the following characteristics apply:

The “person you know” has a new number and contacts you through Whatsapp;

They ask you to help them out by paying a bill for them;

Usually, they are in a rush, the bill needs to be paid quickly;

They cannot, or do not want to, communicate with you through any other means than Whatsapp.

If anyone asks you to transfer money, or to pay an existing bill for them, please always contact this person through other means of communication outside of Whatsapp. When you cannot reach this person, do not transfer any money. 

How can you help stop this kind of fraud? If a link was provided by the scammer make sure to report the IBAN or the link to the police and the relevant bank.



Fake payment requests

If you receive a payment request, always make sure to check the validity of the web page the link leads you to. Often fraudsters will use fake internet pages which look very similar to the normal payment environment of a bank, but the website is in fact a fake one. The information you enter in this payment request is directly visible to the fraudsters and might be used to access your bank account. 

Never enter your information if you do not trust the payment link or the person that is sending you the payment request. 


Marketplace fraud

There are many time where you will find the item you were looking for on second hand websites. This is great!  Second hand items are cheaper and reusing products contributes to a greener world. Unfortunately, sometimes the person who promises to send you the product doesn’t deliver after you have paid. 

How do you recognise these kinds of fraudsters? First, we’d like to emphasise that if something sounds too good to be true, it’s usually because it isn’t true. Always check the market value of the product you want to purchase. If the price of the offered product is too low, this can be a sign that there’s a fraudster at work. 


Don't become a money mule!

If anyone reaches out to you to ask you for access to your bank account or to transfer some money through your bank account, never comply with this request, no matter how promising it sounds! 

Here's an example: Someone reaches out to you through social media or friends and promises you an amount of money. They promise you this money if you transfer some funds for them, or if they can use your bank account for a few days. They will tell you there is no risk involved, and that it is really easy money. 

It is highly likely that your bank account will be used for criminal activity, for which you will be held (criminally) liable. Consequences of this may be that you will not be able to open bank accounts, get a mortgage or obtain credit and that criminal proceedings may follow.  

Again, please realise that if something sounds too good to be true, this usually is because it is not true. 

For more information on money mules, please check out this website by the Dutch police. 



What to do if you became a victim of fraud or you are suspecting fraud?

Check your bank account frequently, and always read your bankmail swiftly after receiving it. If you have been a victim of fraudsters, contact your bank immediately. 

If you are suspecting fraud, please give notice to your bank about your suspicions. 

The form to report suspected fraud or scams to bunq can be found here.",Local Ibans,phishing is an attempt by fraudsters to obtain your personal information . they often disguise themselves as a trustworthy party by using fake websites .

173,How does my bunq card work with deposits? ,"['Knowledge', 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'Cards']","


We have four types of mastercards at bunq; The Travel Card, Mastercard Debit, Business Card and our beautiful Metal Card. All cards are official mastercards, but of course, without the risk of falling into debt. You will be able to use your cards for a deposit, and that’s why we explain more about it in this topic. 



Debited from your IBAN
As no credit is used when making a payment, the full amount of the deposit will be deducted directly from your account when making a purchase. Meaning you should have funds available in your account when paying the deposit. The money will be deducted from the IBAN linked to your card. You’d like to change that IBAN? No problem! Check out this page



When do I receive my money back?
Once the merchant releases your deposit, you will receive the funds back in your account. Imagine you’re at a gas station and the merchant reserved an amount on your card before you use the tank. Once your tank is full, they will charge you for the actual amount. The reservation will be released and a new payment for the gas will be created. 



Refund
A merchant can revert an existing transaction. Receiving refunds directly to your card as a stand alone payment is not possible. What is possible, is for the merchant to transfer the card payment to the IBAN linked to your card. You can find this IBAN when going to the card and tap on linked accounts. Need a refund for a payment? Check out this page for more info. Please note that refunds from our side are only possible for card payments and direct debits.

180,Pro Tips for bunq Freelancers - Taxes made easy ,"['Knowledge', 'Business Center', 'Tips']","We know that freelancing takes some serious skills, passion and time. That’s why we want to make your life easy and provide you with all of the helpful tools needed to be successful.
Here are some of our pro tips on how to bank like a true professional 💪



Automate your VAT 📱

Leave the boring jobs to the machines and focus on doing what you love - growing your business. Did you know VAT can be automated at bunq? Yes, VAT is as easy as 1,2,3. Just set up Auto VAT in your bunq app and always know the exact amount of VAT you owe! You can learn how to set up your Auto VAT right away here. 



Keep 30% of your income, for taxes 💳

Of course, income tax obligations differ from business to business. As a freelancer, everything you earn from the services you provide is gross and you must pay income taxes for it. A general way to ensure you have enough money for taxes is to reserve 30% of your business income. With bunq, you can set aside this amount into a separate sub-account so you have a better overview of your income after tax!

For our Dutch freelancers 🇳🇱

Take advantage of your allowances. Make the most of time spent on your business. Once you work more than 1225 hours in a year  for your company (24h a week), it's possible to receive a tax allowance of up to 46%! In addition, if your turnover does not exceed €20, 000 per year, you are exempt from VAT. You can find more information about these and more allowances here

For our German freelancers 🇩🇪

Take advantage of lower income taxes. Money is an important factor to growing your business. That's why the German government taxes your profits rather than your revenue. You can add up a couple of things as business costs, like rent, internet or travel equipment. The higher your business costs, the lower the net income and tax you will be paying. In addition, if you make less than €22,000 in your first year and less than €50,000 in your second year, you are considered a small business and do not need to charge VAT to your clients! Make sure you keep track of all the receipts with Receipt Scanner and claim your tax deductions effortlessly.

For our French freelancers 🇫🇷

Take advantage of lower social security payments. Running a small business in France has a lot of advantages. One cool benefit is that you're  eligible for a 50% reduction of your social security contributions in the 1st  year of starting your business! Invest this money again on whatever helps your dreams grow. In your second year, you’ll only pay 50% of the CFE tax; and that’s not all - there are many other exemptions you can access. Check the eligibility criteria here to see if you qualify.

Bugfixes

iOS

Fixed: Users had let us know that VoiceOver was not reading and recognizing features in the bunq app, but we’ve fixed that! 

Fixed: The Action Menu was missing from your Tribes and Common Goals screen. We fixed it!

Fixed: After subsequently creating some bunq.me links, we'd show you the wrong url in the screen to share your link with friends. All good now!

Fixed: Some QR codes were not working properly, but that has been fixed! You can seamlessly login to your bunq app using QR codes now! 


Android

Fixed: It appeared that after the app was closed in the background, the Action Menu would stop functioning. We fixed it ✨

Fixed: Creating a Joint Account would first result in an account named ‘Personal’. Now, you’ll get one named ‘Joint’. 💏

Together we’ve planted 50,000 trees simply by inviting friends!

We always knew our community was amazing, but wow! When we started this journey to plant trees together, we were excited about making the world a greener place. Our hope was that as a community, we could help the environment effortlessly. You spend as usual and forests grow - simple as that. 


What have we been able to achieve  together?
Guess what? We have planted 50,000 trees, all thanks to our growing bunq community 🎉🎉 Just imagine: you have grown a forest by simply spreading the love and inviting loved ones to join bunq 🦄⭐️We are immensely grateful that we were able to reach such an achievement together! 



What does this mean for the future?
What does planting 50,000 trees mean? Through our partnership with Eden Reforestation Projects, our bunq forest is going to capture 15.4 MILLION KG of CO2 over its 25 year lifespan! By planting this massive forest together just by spreading the love, we showed what great things we can do as a community to make sure we have a greener and brighter future ahead of us!.


Looking to join the bunq community and bank with your friends for a greener future? We can't wait to meet you and grow together!

195,How to maximise your savings with bunq and ZeroFX! ,"['Knowledge', 'Features', ""What's New?"", 'Tips', 'Community']","Here at bunq we offer a  special perk to our bunqers known as ZeroFX! Basically, we help you save up to 3% by removing the currency conversion fee for both international card payments and ATM withdrawals. That means more money in your pocket! 

You might be thinking that’s great, but it’s not like I can travel anywhere right now. Well...just wait! With ZeroFx you can save even more than the 3% we originally talked about!  How? One of our community members offered some valuable insights on this here.

Like most people nowadays, you probably enjoy shopping online and using your bunq cards to pay for your purchases right away. Here’s a little insider tip (thanks to our Ace user L): If you want to save more $$, switch to the shop’s local currency! 

Our avid bunqer L, who was kind enough to share this tip with us, saved €200 in a single year just by using this tip!! 

Example: A great pair of sneakers from an American store, listed for €100. Go ahead and change your currency option from EURO to USD. Most times, the price will be adjusted and you’ll see the item now listed for $100 USD. When you pay with your bunq card, not only does bunq cover the 1.5% currency conversion fee for you, but with current exchange rates the adjusted price will save you way more than 3%! It’s a win all around! 


This thread comes from L and the original topic is HERE. We’re always happy to hear tips from you, so feel free to share them with the bunq community here on Together!

After signing up for a personal account, you will automatically receive a 1 month free trial of our Easy Green plan! 🌳 What does that mean? It means that with this trial you can experience all of our amazing app features AND plant trees at no extra cost!!  



With an Easy Green plan, one of the best parts is that for every €100 you spend, we plant a new tree!!  Spend with any of your bunq cards, and let every transaction add up to a greener future. 🌳🌈 Not only that, but you can go carbon neutral in less than two years! 🙌 Just imagine: in those two years you could basically plant your own forest simply by spending your money. We do all the planting for you! 

Once a month has passed from your sign-up date, you are free to choose between downgrading to the Easy Bank or Easy Money plan, or to continue with your Easy Green plan! It’s that simple 🎉

Heads up! If you decide to downgrade to the Easy Bank plan after your trial finishes, please keep in mind that:

You will keep one card and the others will be deactivated. As a tip: we recommend still holding on to them. This way, if you decide to upgrade to Easy Green in the future, you can reactivate your cards and immediately use them once again!

You can’t create any new monetary accounts.
You can't have more than one active monetary account before you can downgrade. So, make sure you close other monetary accounts first.

Opening a business account with us requires all of the directors which are part of it to also have a verified personal account. 

Now, as of 8th of September 2021, you'll be able to log into your bunq business account via the personal credentials of the business director(s). 



Why do you have personal accounts for the directors of your business account?

One main reason why we create a personal account together with the business one is to allow for more flexibility for businesses with multiple directors. In order to keep everything organized now you’ll be able to login into your business account with your director’s personal account aliases. This will allow you to keep a better overview of your business and your personal account if you have one.
As a bank, we are legally required to store all of our users’ personal information in a secure way. Creating personal accounts for the directors of the business accounts allows us to keep your and your company’s information safe while complying with this regulation. 



FAQ for directors

I need to add a new director to my business account. How can I do that? 

You can follow this easy process in order to invite your new director right away:

Ask the new director to download the bunq app and sign up for a personal bunq account. This is only necessary to receive the invite to be added as a director to the business account. 
Once the new director has a Personal bunq account, you can log into the business account and go to Profile &gt; Tap on Settings in the right corner on top &gt; Company settings &gt; Manage Directors &gt; Add Director.
Send an invite to the new director by entering the same phone number that your colleague used to sign up for their personal bunq account.
The new director will then receive an invite in the bunq app, and once approved your colleague will get access to the business account right away! 🎉

You can always find more information on this process here

I forgot my security code and I can't login, what should I do? 

You can reset your security code by following the “Forgot security code?” process on your login screen. You can check more information on the process here

Once you’ve reset the security code, when you log in with your director’s credentials, you’ll be able to see your business account’s overview too. 

What exactly changes after the 8th of September 2021 regulation? 

Complying with banking regulations, we're legally required to know who logged in at all times. That is why as of 8th of September 2021, it won’t be possible to log into bunq via your business credentials. Instead, you’ll need to log into bunq via the personal credentials of the business director(s).

Directors will be able to manage the business accounts next to their personal accounts. Of course, you’ll still have access to the same business functionalities, plus one easy overview of both your business and personal banking matters.

Guest account

We want to give you the flexibility and freedom to use bunq for both your personal and business needs 🙌

You can use your personal account alongside the business one, or have it switched to a Guest account if you don’t intend to use it for anything else besides accessing the company account.

You can learn how to get a Guest account for directors here 💼

213,What is a P-Konto?,"['Knowledge', 'Germany']","Some of you have asked us whether bunq is offering a P-Konto. 🌈 



What is a P-Konto?

Pfändungsschutzkonten (or P-Konto) is a type of account that exists only in Germany. It is used to protect the users’ funds from creditors with the intention to protect the minimum funds necessary for living and simultaneously ease the work of courts and their bailiffs.



Does bunq offer P-Konto?

Now that we know what P-Konto is and what it is used for, let’s discuss whether bunq offers it.

Even though we support German IBANs, our banking license is from the Netherlands so we do not currently offer P-Kontos. We are legally required to follow instructions from authorities if it concerns a garnishment or account seizure.

However, you don’t have to worry about the security of your bunq account because we only process official communication from authorities and your funds are safe with us.

220,Can I receive a SWIFT payment?,['Knowledge'],"
Your bunq account is a Dutch SEPA account in EUR. That is why all money sent to your account will have to be converted to EUR beforehand. 


What is SWIFT?

SWIFT payments are international transfers processed via the SWIFT international payment network unlike regular SEPA payments. This network is one of the largest in the world.  Most of these payments are coming from banks that are not within the SEPA region. 🌍

If you have an e-money account, we will not be able to process your incoming SWIFT payment, you are required to fully verify your account before your SWIFT payment arrives. If not, it will be returned to the sending bank.


How long does it take to arrive?
Normally SWIFT payments are received in 2-3 working days, but they can take up to a week to arrive. SWIFT payments are more complex and time-consuming to process, so we apply a processing fee. You can find the fee in our pricing list


What if my SWIFT payment hasn't arrived?

If your SWIFT payment has not arrived, we ask that you reach out the sender or sending bank. Please ask them to investigate and provide you with the reference for the payment. You can then reach out to our Support team with the gathered information and we will do a target search on our end.


Wise

When you would like to send and receive payments in different currencies, we recommend using Wise as an intermediary bank. Wise makes it faster and cheaper than traditional banks to send and receive payments in 39 different currencies!
You can also rely on our app’s built-in integration with Wise to send money to foreign accounts! 🙌

230,4 ideas to make this summer last longer ☀️,"['Community Travel Tips', 'Community']","

August is coming to a close, days are getting shorter, and the temperature is falling 📉 which means that the fall is coming 🍃

But wait a minute - we still have a full month of summer ahead! ☀️ Here are our ideas to make the most out of them, even if you've already come back from your vacation 🏝

1. Use up the weather!

Crowded places should be a no-go in the current situation, but milder temperatures mean better conditions to embrace nature 🌳 Spending time in the local park or walking in a nearby forest can provide a great deal of shadow from the sun ⛅️ Don't be afraid to get active! A jog between the trees is great for your lungs too 🌬

2. Soak up the sun... at home! 🏡

The harsh summer sun is not very inviting nor pleasant, but late August provides some balance, making it the perfect time to soak in the warmth - even in the comfort of your own home 🏠 If you're lucky enough to be able to work from home, set up your personal office in your garden, on your balcony, or even by the window - and bask in the sun rays to get the energy you need for your daily tasks! ⚡️

3. Surround yourself with plants 🌱

Summer is a great time for gardening and watching your plants bloom 🌻 With the fall right around the corner, you can still recreate a summer garden in your home with some herbs, like mint, basil, lavender, or sage 🌿 They will thrive on your kitchen counter just as well as outside if you provide them with a bit of sunlight and water every day, and the scent will remind you of summer in no time. Even if the fall days become gray and dull, you can always smell your plants to get that summery feel 🙌

4. You can still go on a trip... online! 💻

Used up your vacation days? Travel is difficult under current restrictions? No worries - summer is not over until you say it's over 😎 Recently bunq has partnered up with Withlocals, giving our subscribers 10% off of their trips - and they have an amazing catalog of virtual trips with guides who'll show you the most iconic places on Earth while you can relax on your couch! 🌍 Give it a try!

Login changes to the bunq app

To make sure you have a 100% carefree experience with your money, we always aim to stay ahead of global developments. With worldwide reports of fraud (most notably phishing) increasing rapidly since the onset of COVID-19, we implemented a few innovative safety features to your bunq app, to help keep you and your money safe.



New safety features 🤓

Temporary access link: if you log in to your bunq account on a new device, we’ll automatically send you an access link to your phone. This is a unique “magic” link that will give you access to the app and can’t easily be shared with others.
When your bunq account is accessed on a new device, we will also apply a 24h cooldown period. You can find more information about it here.

Because these new features are both safer and easier to use than using a Hand scan or a passphrase to authenticate your account, these two will be discontinued. This way you're guaranteed your account is getting the best possible protection! Easier and safer than ever! ✨

The new security features are added to the current lineup of safety measures in the bunq app: Fingerprint/face recognition, your 6-digit security code (previously “Login Code”), video verification, and top-up from a different bank account under your name.

240,Phishing scams,['No Tag'],"

We have been made aware of ongoing phishing scams that are pretending to be bunq, asking you to login on https://bunq.top/7ce30eeb956b8bbdecfdb304b556edba/page1.php and http://app.deblokkeren-bunq.com/inloggen. We want to address this and give you some further information on the phishing reports we have received to make you aware and avoid falling victim to the scam.



What is phishing? 🎣
Phishing is a form of fraud where the scammer will send communications (emails, texts, messages over social media) pretending to be from reputable companies or institutions to trick you into sending money or sharing your personal details (such as passwords, account details and card numbers).

For more information on phishing and how to prevent being phished have a look at this topic.



Phishing reports concerning bunq
We have received reports about a website pretending to be bunq. Make sure you do not enter any of your personal data via links received via SMS or via email.

Make sure that you do not click on the link you receive via SMS or email and do not share any personal information. You can always verify the security of your bunq account in the bunq app.

What will happen next

We are aware and have reported the scam to our internal team. They are currently taking the required actions to keep everyone safe. 👍



Keeping your bunq account secured

To verify that your bunq account is secured, you can follow these steps:

go to Security to change your login code.
go to Security and tap on ""Devices"". From there, delete any device that you do not recognise.
go to Profile and tap on your name. From there, delete any phone number or email address that you do not recognise.


Was there a security breach at bunq?

No, your data is safe at bunq. Privacy and security are our top priorities. This means we will never share your personal data to third parties without your permission. You can learn more here.

Scammers performing phishing scams will send the same SMS to huge amounts of random phone numbers, or emails to random email addresses. It happens that some of those receiving the SMS or email will also have an account at bunq.

We advise to always open the bunq app yourself, and to not open links you receive via SMS or email.



Do you need to report something? 🌈
You can report phishing websites here. If it's a fraudulent user, you can help keep bunq safe. Simply send an email to report@bunq.com and we’ll take it from there. If reporting a possible fraudster, please include their account number and any information you have related to the case.",NA,bunq has received reports of phishing scams pretending to be bunq .

254,Stuck at home? Travel online! ✈️,"['Community Travel Tips', ""What's New?"", 'Community']","

We’re almost halfway through the summer vacation and many of us are unable to explore the world like we used to before the lockdown 🔒

Staying at home this summer? Here are a few ways you can see the world, learn something new, and have fun - all while staying safe on your couch 🏡

See amazing art! 🎨

When visiting major cities, it’s always a good idea to see what local museums have to offer. Many institutions have their entire collections available online, so you still can see the world’s greatest pieces of art while at home! You can check out exhibitions from Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the vast riches of Museum Island in Berlin, or even the Louvre - for free!

Explore the unknown! 🕵️‍♂️

Some people prefer the alpha cities of the world, and some thrive in the unknown, exploring deeper parts of the countries they visit. Wanna get a little lost out there somewhere? With online geography quizzes like GeoGuessr or Seterra, you are thrown into a random place using Google Street View, and your objective is to look around for clues and figure out where in the world you are!

Learn more about countries! 🌍

When traveling, we have a unique opportunity to learn so much about other cultures and people; and while it’s unlikely a person can visit all of the countries in the world to learn all of that firsthand in their lifetime, you can visit the Geography Now channel on YouTube, where a few geo-geeks have undertaken a tremendous task of explaining what every country in the world is all about - in alphabetical order. The project is still ongoing, and while jam-packed with knowledge, it’s just plain fun to binge-watch.

Create a new world with your friends! 👥

Everyday life got you down? Dreaming of an unreal getaway? We can always count on video games for that. You can fly away to a deserted island and create your dream world in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, or move away to a charming farm town and live a more peaceful life in Stardew Valley. These games have been a big part of lockdown life for many, and both of them support online multiplayer, so you can spend time with your friends and create your own fantasy life together!


While virtual travel is fun, we care about the real world too. With bunq SuperGreen, you can plant trees and reduce your CO2 footprint with every card purchase!

255,Going Dutch made easy with bunq 🌈,"[""What's New?"", 'Community']","

As we shift back to a more open world after the recent lockdown, people are eager to go back to their standard routines. On a regular Friday night, it's nice to hang out with your friends at a local bar or a diner and unwind after a long week of hard work 💪

This is especially true in the Netherlands, a country with a long-standing tradition of bars and cafés being filled to the brim on almost every night of the week - Dutch people love going out! 🍽

Frequent Dutch nightlife gatherings created another tradition - going Dutch on the bill 📝 But what does that mean?

In the Netherlands, it's customary to split the bill amongst everyone, with special care given to who ordered what 👀While some people might not be used to this, it's commonplace in the Lowlands 🇳🇱

So, while spending your night out on the town, remember not only to keep a safe distance and wear your mask when required but also to deal with the bill accordingly! Luckily, with the bunq app, you can go Dutch and collect payments within seconds ⌚️Simply tap on any payment, select the “Split” option and you can get your money back in seconds. You enjoy a night out with friends, and let bunq help you with who paid for what!

💰 What currency do they use here?
The currency here is Euros! The symbol is € or EUR.


🏧 Which ATM’s can I use for free?
The bunq community has reported free withdrawals at these ATMs.

All EU mobile plans should let you roam for free.

If you don't have an EU plan, you can learn about your local SIM card options here.


  
Useful things to know
💁‍♀️ How does tipping work?
Tipping is fairly common in Austria. After a nice meal, you would usually tip somewhere from 10-12%.

Check if the restaurant has already added a service charge before tipping. If they have, you don't need to tip.

When being served in a cafe, it is common to round up the bill to the next Euro. 
🍺 How much does a 0.5L beer cost?
€4,00
🍽 How much does an average meal cost?
€10,00
🚨 What’s the emergency number?

🔌 What type of plug do they use?
This one! It’s the standard European plug.



🚗 What side of the road do they drive on?
They drive on the right side of the road here.
🗺 How do I navigate my way around?
Google and Apple Maps both work well in Austria.

Otherwise, we recommend Rome2Rio as the best way to find out how to get anywhere. It even tells you the cost of each option. 🙌
👀 Any other good tips?
If you're in Vienna, head to Café Central for an amazing Apple Strudel in a historic atmosphere.

261,bunq Tips - The ultimate guide on how to become a bunq user in seconds,"['Knowledge', ""What's New?"", 'Tips']","Hello there! 

Do you remember our friend Christian, the guy from a previous bunq Tips post? He didn’t have a bunq account, so he couldn't enjoy all the amazing features that help him save time, money and CO2. 😉 Check out this post to get the full story. 

So, the good news is that Christian has decided to join bunq and spread the rainbow! Let’s follow him on this journey and explore bunq together!



How does it work?

At bunq, we value the freedom of managing your account on your own terms. That’s why we give you the option to complete your profile whenever you want. You decide when the time is right for you. 
So once Christian downloads the app here 🍎 or here 🤖, he can already start exploring the basics of bunq, skipping all unnecessary paperwork. By accepting our Terms &amp; Conditions, he can easily top up his account and use bunq to pay for products and services, as long as they are located in a country he lives in. He can also order a Travel Card or Maestro card with just a tap in the app!

By simply downloading the bunq app Christian can instantly use what is called an e-money account. This is not a full bank account, but an electronic money account that allows you to immediately use bunq to start saving money and time! You can find more information on this page.

We also give all new bunq users the possibility to discover our community. For example, in the Us tab you can discover everything about the bunq community. You can see the investments of the bunq community, you can check out Tribes of other users and the number of trees they plant together as well as Common Goals. 



How do I get a full bunq bank account?

Swayed by how easy it was to start using bunq, Christian decided to get a full-fledged bank account. All it took for him was to open the app and go to Profile &gt; Profile Completion &gt; Make sure you’re secure. This allowed him to verify his identity and set up a full bank account in seconds. 🎉

263,How to retire early? 💸,"[""What's New?"", 'Community']","

Who has never dreamed of leaving their work behind in their 30s and experiencing life at its greatest? That is why the FIRE movement was created - to make this dream possible ☁️

What is the FIRE movement? 🔥

FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early, and it consists of saving a high percentage of your salary so you can retire early. Yes, that means that instead of buying a mojito on a sunny terrace, you’ll save those 7 Euros. But that also means that when you’re 35 and your friends are stuck at work, you’ll be enjoying your life by sleeping in and traveling. How great is that?


How do I do it? 👀

The FIRE movement has a simple principle: decrease your expenses and increase your income. Easier said than done? Agreed. While it might not sound easy it’s actually feasible if you’re willing to make your savings a priority. Here are a few tips to start with:


Auto Save! 💸

With the bunq app, you can easily create a Savings Goal for your early retirement and save automatically as you go, using Auto Save! With every purchase or payment you make, a small portion of your funds will be automatically transferred to your Savings Goal. It may seem like amounts deposited to your savings are small, but you’ll notice how quickly things start adding up! Read more about Savings Goals and Auto Save here.

Optimize your expenses 📈

Of course, you’ll still have to buy groceries and pay your rent, but try cutting unnecessary expenses wherever possible. Sharing a flat is one of the easiest ways to cut down on expensive rent. You’re gonna need to save a very high percentage of your salary to retire early: every Euro matters!

Cut corners on inessential things 🧐

Want to change your sofa to match the new trends? Don’t! Thinking about buying this lovely jacket you saw on your friend yesterday? Don’t! Your current sofa and jacket are probably still doing their job very well, so why swap something that still has a lot to give? You don’t and you save that money to retire early. Plus, in the current fast-fashion society, squeezing some extra mileage from clothes and furniture is a great way to cut down on your carbon footprint!

Know your worth 🤑

Whether you have the possibility to grow from your current position or have a little business on the side, every way is good to increase your income. What matters is that you work with one goal in mind: earning more and saving the difference!


In a few years, you might just have saved enough to retire early and enjoy a life where your work needs you more than you need it, and that’s the dream, right? ✨

Don’t forget that bunq is here to help you in this journey, activate Auto Save to start saving automatically without even thinking about it!

Thank you for submitting your paperwork and congratulations on applying for a full bank account! We are excited to have you join the bunq community. 🌈


How long does it take?
It usually takes only a few minutes for the verification to be completed, but in a few cases it can take a couple of hours.

Why is this verification needed?
After downloading the bunq app, you can instantly top-up your account and start making payments with an e-money account. No paperwork, no hassle! Depending on how you use your bunq account, we might ask you to complete a one-time verification.

When you want to make certain usage of your bunq account, we are required by law to verify your identity. This way, you can continue using your money freely and safely with bunq. 

Expecting an incoming payment, but don't want to proceed further with verification? No worries, because you will have an option to transfer the amount back. 💸

267,"bunq Tips - Easily accept B2B Direct Debits, without the need for any paperwork!","['Knowledge', 'Features', 'Business Center', 'Tips']","Hey there everyone! 🌤

If you’re a bunq Business user, you may have noticed other users asking about B2B SDD from time to time. Even though acronyms are an easy way to name things, it’s hard to remember all of them. But no worries, we’ve got you covered on this one! ⛱ Get a beverage and let us tell you what B2B SDD is and how to use it step-by-step. Let’s begin! 



What is B2B SDD?

It stands for Business to Business SEPA Direct Debits 🤗 These are payments that companies can charge to your IBAN, usually for recurring payments, such as membership fees. 

For example, you recently set up a new contract with your network provider, and they send you the monthly costs to your bunq account. However, you notice that they seem to have charged youa higher fee than you expected. Luckily, with bunq you can choose to approve or deny the Direct Debits that you receive. This means you're in full control and can always decide not to pay a direct debit.



How does it work?

As a rule, Direct Debits are set up like ""contracts"" using a paper form. The SDD issuer gives you the two copies of the papers to set up the B2B Direct Debit. You need to fill out one copy by entering your bunq IBAN and send it back to the SDD issuer. The other copy is usually for the bank, but since we're not a big fan of any paper form we've integrated this in the app. We will send you a push notification to authorize this request. When receiving it you have the option to accept it (for one day) and when accepted the contract is formed. If no action is taken before the indicated period, the Direct Debit will expire and we will automatically decline it. 

We provide full freedom to you so you can make complete use of your account and any service you want to link to it. 🌈 

This feature is only available for Business users
It is not possible to refund B2B Direct Debit, you need to contact the other party.
All future B2B Direct Debits will be accepted automatically from the same company

269,Why is planting trees so important? 🌳🌳🌳,"[""What's New?"", 'Community']","

Lately, we’ve invested a lot of time helping you plant trees as you go. Some of you may wonder - why is planting trees so important? 🧐

1. Helps you reduce your carbon footprint

A mature tree can absorb up to 21 kilograms of carbon dioxide per year. 2 trees can already absorb the entire amount of CO2 produced by one person - and how cool is that? 🤯 With every planted tree, you reduce the CO2 levels in the atmosphere, purifying the air you breathe 🌬

If you’re curious, find out what is your current carbon footprint!

2. Trees are homes too

Trees, especially in forests, harbor many species of wildlife. When you plant trees, you support biodiversity by expanding the natural habitat of many endangered animal species. You can keep your assets in your bunq account - but squirrels need trees for that 🐿️ 

3. It’s the easiest way to become CO2-free

Being mindful of your everyday choices is a great start - and by planting trees, you get to really speed things up! ⚡ By using bunq SuperGreen you can go carbon neutral in under 2 years without any effort! 💪

We’re proud to show you how bunq SuperGreen, with the help from our partners at the Eden Reforestation Projects, plants real trees 🌳

In June alone, we have planted over 200,000 trees thanks to our SuperGreen users, which adds up to a grand total of 700,000 trees! You rock 🙌 Join bunq SuperGreen and start banking towards a more sustainable future today! 🌿",NA,a mature tree can absorb up to 21 kilograms of carbon dioxide per year .

272,Why am I switched to the Easy Money plan?,['No Tag'],"

In April we announced the release of 2 new plans: Easy Green Personal and Easy Green Business


In doing this we discontinued the bunq Free, More, Premium Limited &amp; Joint subscriptions and upgraded these users to the full bunq Easy Money experience, for free for the first 3 months. This way you got to experience bunq at its greatest without any hassle.


This 3 months trial is ending in June and we hope you enjoyed your bunq Easy Money experience. 



This topic covers:

Why did I receive an email?
Why are Free, More, Joint and Premium Limited discontinued?
How can I cancel my new plan? 
Is it possible to keep my previous plan?
Why didn’t I know my plan was discontinued?
How can I close my account?
 


Why did I receive an email?

If you received an email mentioning your trial is ending soon, this means you had a legacy  subscription with us (Free, More, Joint or Premium Limited), and is now being fully discontinued. Prior to fully discontinuing these subscriptions,  you were upgraded to a free trial of Easy Money for 3 months, read all about it here 

If you are a Business account holder, you might have received an email as well if you were using paid features such as Zapier, Auto-Export, Scan receipts and Auto VAT. These paid features are now all included in the Easy Green Business plan and you have been automatically upgraded. You can, of course, keep a Business plan. Read more about it here 



Why are Free, More, Joint and Premium Limited discontinued?

We came to a point where a hard choice was necessary. We had over 10 plans models many of which were discontinued for years and they slowed down the development of the bunq app. This prevented us from introducing new features to improve the bunq experience.  Therefore, in April, we decided to fully discontinue these old plans, to be able to continuously improve our product and give you the best banking experience to make your life easy.

These memberships were discontinued in April. We offered you 3 months of Easy Money for free, as a transition period, to let you explore the additional benefits Easy Money had to offer. You were recently notified by email the 3 months trial would be ending soon.

To check your billing date, go to Profile &gt;⚙️ &gt; My plan&gt; Upcoming Invoice



How can I cancel my plan?


If you want to cancel your Premium plan, you can switch to another plan easily. Simply:

Tap on the Profile tab
Tap on the Settings in the top-right corner
Choose Switch Plan
Choose the plan of your choice

You can also see the steps here.



Is it possible to keep my previous plan?


We discontinued the Free, More, Joint &amp; Premium limited subscriptions. Therefore, it is not possible to keep them. For more information, check out this post to see which plan fits your needs best!



Why didn’t I know my plan was discontinued?


We sent an email to all our Free, More, Joint &amp; Premium limited users in April 2020, informing you of the changes to our plans, allowing you 3 additional months to try all the amazing bunq Premium features that make life easy.



How can I cancel my account?

Of course, we’d love for you to stay with us, but if you would like to close your account, this can be done in a matter of seconds. Simply follow the steps below:

Did you get a chance to explore all the awesome features of the new app? Well, on this Sunday afternoon we're going to reveal some magic taps which will make your bunq experience even more special. 🦄



Remove your old card from Cards overview 🗑

We have all been in a situation when one of your exes starts popping up in places when you don’t expect. But what about your old cards? No need to keep an eye on them either once you decided to burn the bridges and permanently block them. In V3 app you can remove your card from the Cards overview, for good. 
Check out the steps below to see how:
Go to Home tab and tap on Cards
Choose your card
Select Freeze
Tap on 🚫 Block 



Keep in mind that once you block the card, you won’t be able to reactivate it and use it again



Balance or progress? 🤔

Are you saving for your next trip, new gadget or any other cool stuff with a Savings Goal? Cool! We’ve got you covered 💪
To help you track your progress towards the goal even more effectively we decided to show both percentage and numbers in the app. Just tap on the circle in the middle and check out how much ﹪ or € left before you reach your dream. Go to Home tab and select your savings sub-account.





Attach a receipt to your payment 🧾

We’ve noticed that some of you couldn’t find one of the most beloved features - adding receipts and notes to single transactions… Just watch the video below to see how to do that and continue to enjoy bunq by saving time, every time. 








Split payments ✂️

You can easily split payments with your friends in your bunq app by filling in their names or sharing the link with them. We also implemented some quick actions which will help you to maneuver your events much easier and smoother.
Check out the steps in the video below:







Freedom of Choice 💡

We wouldn’t be the bank of The Free without giving you the freedom to decide how your money is invested. You can make the decision within one tap right in your bunq app. Just go to Home &gt; Settings in the top right corner &gt; Freedom of Choice. 

Please keep in mind that by default, some of your money will automatically be stored with the European Central Bank (ECB) and in Government Bonds. 

On the same screen, you will see an Interest toggle which gives you the option whether you want to receive interest or not, and on which sub-account!

274,Save €1378 in 1 year - The 52 weeks challenge,"[""What's New?""]","

On Instagram, we recently asked you what was the 1st goal you saved for. Whatever your dreams are: buying a house, welcoming a baby, investing in the last laptop, we could all use extra cash to realize them.

Want to know how to spare €1378 by the end of the year? Keep reading!

Of course, €1378 won’t appear by magic on your bank account (unfortunately), it demands a little bit of organization ahead, let’s see how it’s done!


The 52 weeks challenge


But what is the 52 weeks challenge? That is the method that will help you save without even realizing it. The principle is very simple: for every week that passes by, put aside the amount of money designated by this week.

Still not visualizing it? That’s ok!

On Week 1, you will put €1 on the side

On Week 22, you will put €22 on the side

On Week 50, you will put €50 on the side

Etc. until the end of the year.


Seems easy? It is! Until those weeks 48, 49, 50 and 51 come up.



How do you hack this challenge?



At bunq, we like to think out of the box, so here are a few tips that will help you to nail this challenge:

Start whenever you will need the money for 52 weeks later: maybe you don’t celebrate Christmas so you won’t need it by the end of the year. But maybe you are planning to travel around the world in June 2021? No problem! Start in June 2020, so you’ve got your €1378 all ready for the big day!

Don’t follow the weeks’ number: make a list of the numbers from 1 to 52 and put on the side what you can when you can. It is not easy to save €48, €49, €50, and €51 in December. Maybe it is easier for you to do so in May? Then do!



How to proceed?



Nothing simpler!


We listened to your idea and created a Zap to save money every week, find it here 👉https://zapier.com/apps/bunq/integrations/schedule/130602/create-draft-payments-in-bunq-on-a-weekly-basis

We told you, the app will do it for you!

As you may know, last month at bunq Update 14 we introduced bunq Tribes, so you can multiply your green impact with your friends and family.

Some of our users dove in right away and created their own Tribes in no time. This is what they told us:


Nienke: “I opened a Tribe with my boyfriend because we wanted to beat our friends, we made a bet and the one couple who has planted the least trees by the end of August needs to invite the other couple to a restaurant, we are 5 trees ahead!”


Nathan: “My cousin had the idea to open a Tribe, I didn’t even know she was using bunq! I happened to mention that my bank was planting trees for every €100 I spent and she connected the dots. Now we have a Tribe-of-two and we are closer than ever”


Sara: “I opened a Tribe with 3 of my friends, we all have a sense of competition and thought that if we have to compete against others, that it should be for a good cause. In the bunq app we can even see how we rank compared to other Tribes. We're in 6th place at the moment!”

277,🇫🇷 Use bunq in France,"['Knowledge', 'France']"," bunq is available in all member countries of the European Economic Area (EEA), making it an international bank. However, not all countries have the same banking habits. That's why we would like to share some tips with our users living in France, a country full of culture, beautiful landscapes and amazing food. 🥐 Know your IBAN As we made our way through the ocean of traditional banks, we were fortunate enough to acquire a banking license: a Dutch banking license, to be precise. This means that when you open an account with bunq , it will have a IBAN which is very suitable for use throughout the EEA (European Economic Area). So don't worry, you can pay your bills very well with your bunq account. Example of IBAN bunq : NLXXBUNQXXXXXXXXXX If you find yourself in a situation where your IBAN is rejected because of its Dutch origin, check if this is IBAN discrimination RIB? I only like barbecue ribs en RIB is the abbreviation of bank identity statement. Some entities may ask you to provide a RIB to prove ownership of your IBAN . To make sure that your bunq account can be used without any limitation, we have introduced a feature that allows you to get it in seconds. You simply need to change the language of your mobile device to French and follow the steps presented here . Checks As an online bank, bunq does not have local divisions. This means that the methods available to deposit your money into a bunq account are fully digital. Currently, our users mainly use Klarna ( SOFORT ), iDeal, wire transfers or credit / debit cards to top up their accounts, although some still prefer a physical check. Our app however only supports fully automated and eco-friendly methods. Fewer checks, less paper, fewer damaged trees. 🌳 If you have a check that needs to be cashed, we recommend that you research whether a local third-party company allows the amount of the check in question to be transferred to the IBAN . Tax number As a bank, we are legally obliged to carry out some checks during the registration process. For example, we need to ask you to provide your TIN (Tax Identification Number). To help our expatriate and underage users, however, we allow a period of 3 months to transmit it! If you create an account for your child, your child's TIN can be connected to yours until they become of legal age. Additional tip : This is the period in France during which our users in France start filing their taxes. On this page you will find more information about it. You want to know more ?

279,5 ways to decrease your carbon footprint 👣,"['Knowledge', 'Community']","


2 weeks ago, we explained to you in this article how to find out your carbon footprint. Well, finding out is great, but improving it is even better, right?

We’ve selected 5 ways for you to decrease your carbon footprint in an easy and impactful way!


1. Switch your everyday objects for sustainable, eco-friendly or fairtrade ones

Like to do Yoga? Buy an eco-friendly mat! Love listening to music while working? Switch to sustainable earphones. Crazy about coffee? Buy fairtrade! 

2. Drive less, cycle more!

If you live in the Netherlands, you probably apply this tip on a day-to-day basis. If you don’t, try to cycle more for small travel. Popping by your favorite bakery cause you’re craving a fresh croissant or saying hello to a friend can probably be done by cycling, right? After a little cycling you’ll deserve this croissant even more and will feel absolutely zero guilt 🥐

3. Reusable, not disposable

Did you know that there are many things in your kitchen that you can switch for others that will last longer and are reusable? A few tips? Use bee wraps instead of cling film to cover your meals in the fridge or buy a reusable cooking mat instead of those parchment paper to cook. As easy as that!

4. Shop responsibly

When shopping, bring a reusable bag with you so you don’t have to accept additional plastic bags that will die in one closet for “next” time. If you like shopping online, a few merchants offer to offset your carbon footprint for your order in exchange for a small fee 🛍💰
Read more about sustainable fashion in our last blog post 

5. Subscribe to SuperGreen and become CO2 free in less than 2 years!

Of course, we wouldn’t make an article about offsetting your carbon footprint without talking about SuperGreen. From just €16,99/ month, become a SuperGreen user and plant 1 tree for every €100 you spend 🌱

Introducing customizable account images &amp; light mode (experimental)
After a lot of tweaking we got customizable images back to work in our V3 design. Set them up by simply going to Settings on your sub account.

We've also reintroduced Light Mode. It doesn't look 100% up to standard yet, but we felt it was good enough to ship for those who've been eagerly awaiting it.




Splitting business &amp; personal accounts
One of the most requested features at V2 was to have 1 overview for business and personal accounts. After launch it turns out that a lot of people appreciate having it separate too, so we dove in and built a separation possibility.

291,What is an e-money account and how do I use it?,"['Knowledge', 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'Signup']","At bunq Update 14, we showed you the all-new bunq app that makes life easy. One of the many things we simplified was signing up at bunq.

And today, we’re launching V3 for everyone! Starting today, anyone can open an e-money account in seconds and start using bunq!



What’s an e-money account?

When new users download the bunq app they can start using bunq instantly. Once they open their bunq account for the first time, they get an e-money account. No paperwork, no hassle. You simply download the bunq app and you start using it right away, getting to know bunq in an easy way.




How does it work?

Simply download the bunq app, accept the terms &amp; conditions, provide your name and your date of birth and you are good to go! You will also be able to order a Travel Card or Maestro card, but you will need to verify your account first by upgrading it to a full bank account and provide your address to get the card delivered 💳
As an e-money user you can only order Virtual card.




What you can do with an e-money account

With your e-money account, you can easily top up your account and use bunq to pay for products and services in the country that you live in.

And if you want to unlock more bunq features, like TransferWise, SWIFT payments and payments via money transfers, you simply upgrade to a full bank account with just a few taps in the app!

Keep in mind that the e-money accounts aren’t covered by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme 





How do I manually upgrade to a full bank account?

You’ll automatically be prompted to upgrade after reaching the limits of your e-money account but you can also switch manually to a full bank account:

Click on the Profile tab
Select Settings in top right corner
Select Personal Information
You can then upgrade your account (make sure to keep your ID at hand!) by tapping on Make sure you're secured

Your account may need verification. Learn more about verifying accounts here.






Who can open an e-money account?

You can open an e-money account if you live in the following countries: Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Greece, Bulgaria, Croatia, Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Malta, Latvia, The Netherlands



My child has opened an account without my knowledge
The account that has been opened by your child is a so-called e-money account. Under European regulations, we are allowed to offer these accounts without verifying the identity of the person opening the account. To avoid fraud and other misconduct, these e-money accounts are limited in their functionalities. This is why your child was able to open their account without any parental approval. In case your child wants to open a full bank account with us, you should give your child permission for this first. If you want to know how to open an account for your child, please check this page. If you would like to keep a full view over your children’s spending, please visit this page

293,bunq Tips - Find out how you can save money in a fun and easy way!,"['Knowledge', 'Features', 'Tips']","

Hi there!

Maybe you are still dreaming of that holiday, that car, that new mobile phone, but you can’t resist the temptation when your friends ask you to go out for a beer? 🍻 Or maybe you ordered too much food at home and you need to grab funds from your savings again in order to make it to the end of the month - we’ve all been there. 😄

Let us help you save more money! How? Create a Savings Goal in the bunq app! You can even save for something together with somebody else by creating a Shared Savings Goal in just a few seconds. 💰



Savings Goals
It's super sweet and easy to use. In the app you simply go to Accounts &gt; Add a new sub-account or group &gt; Savings Goal. You will see a % showing how much you saved so far relative to your goal!
Each time you deposit money into your Savings Goal, you'll see the progress for reaching your goal as a percentage. This helps you stay the course and encourage you to keep saving. You also have the possibility to adjust the goal whenever you feel like it, by going to the Settings of your Savings Goal.

In order to keep you from using money from your Savings Goal for other purposes, you’re only able to withdraw all money, or nothing at all. We want you to reach your goals, as fast as possible! 



Shared Savings Goal
Easy right? You can also open a Shared Savings Goal, which allows you to invite family members, friends and partners to save money with you if they have a bunq account as well. Something to keep in mind is that inviting additional members to the sub-account is not possible after its creation. It has to be done during the setup. 🙏😇

Cool fact: Your Savings Goal comes with its own IBAN and making transfers to that IBAN is possible!


Auto Save
Apart from helping you stay the course, we also make it easy for you to save money: with Auto Save you get to save money without having to think about it. This particular savings method will round each payment to the next multiple of €1, €2, or €5 you make and save the difference! It will be deposited automagically to your Savings Goal. It can be enabled either when you create your Savings Goal, or simply by going to its Settings.

To show you how it exactly works, let us give you some examples:

Round up to €1
  You make a payment of €3.50 &gt; Save €0.50
Round up to €2
Payment of €16.00 &gt; Save €2.00
Payment of €11.00 &gt; Save €1.00
Round up to €5
Payment of €10.00 &gt; Save €5.00
Payment of €12.00 &gt; Save €3.00

295,Phishing scam: bunq.com/controleomgeving & bunq.app.y1mp4s.info,['No Tag'],"

We have been made aware of ongoing phishing scams that are pretending to be bunq, asking you to login on bunq.com/controleomgeving or bunq.app.y1mp4s.info. We want to address this and give you some further information on the phishing reports we have received to make you aware and avoid falling victim to the scam.



What is phishing? 🎣
Phishing is a form of fraud where the scammer will send communications (emails, texts, messages over social media) pretending to be from reputable companies or institutions to trick you into sending money or sharing your personal details (such as passwords, account details and card numbers).

For more information on phishing and how to prevent being phished have a look at this topic.



Phishing reports concerning bunq
We have received reports about a website pretending to be bunq. Make sure you do not enter any of your personal data via links received via SMS or via email.

This website uses the following phishing email to steal your login credentials:



Note that the email comes from Bunq@helpdesk.nl, which is not an email address owned by bunq. All the official bunq email addresses end in @bunq.com

Make sure that you do not click on the link you receive via SMS or email and do not share any personal information. You can always verify the security of your bunq account in the bunq app.

What will happen next

We are aware and have reported the scam to our internal team. They are currently taking the required actions to keep everyone safe. 👍



Keeping your bunq account secured

To verify that your bunq account is secured, you can follow these steps:

go to Security to change your login code.
go to Security and tap on ""Devices"". From there, delete any device that you do not recognise.
go to Profile and tap on your name. From there, delete any phone number or email address that you do not recognise.


Was there a security breach at bunq?

No, your data is safe at bunq. Privacy and security are our top priorities. This means we will never share your personal data to third parties without your permission. You can learn more here.

Scammers performing phishing scams will send the same SMS to huge amounts of random phone numbers, or emails to random email addresses. It happens that some of those receiving the SMS or email will also have an account at bunq.

We advise to always open the bunq app yourself, and to not open links you receive via SMS or email.



Do you need to report something? 🌈
You can report phishing websites here. If it's a fraudulent user, you can help keep bunq safe. Simply send an email to report@bunq.com and we’ll take it from there. If reporting a possible fraudster, please include their account number and any information you have related to the case.",NA,"bunq has been made aware of ongoing phishing scams that are pretending to be bunq, asking you to login on bunq."
